Hotel Name,Review
Chicago South Loop Hotel,"The place gave me a creepy vibe, mostly because of the lighting’s Parking was included No outside lights when I was checking in,even though it was dark outside. I initially thought the hotel was out of business. The lighting inside also was very dim. The hair dryer had been removed from the wall and I had to go get one from the front desk."
Chicago South Loop Hotel,Good price for marathon weekend but a 3 star hotel Friendly staff and good location for the marathon. Room was spacious and beds were comfy. We were upgraded to 2 double beds for free on arrival and given a free early check in. Everything a bit tired and in need of an update. The shower didn’t work very well and at least one lift was out of order each day. Breakfast wasn’t great (self serve cold buffet) and coffee was not good.
Chicago South Loop Hotel,It was average Close to town Noise at night
Chicago South Loop Hotel,"Comfortable and quite just outside of downtown. The bed was very comfortable and the hotel was quiet at night.
I was attending a conference at McCormick Place and this is a fantastic location for walking to the event.
When I was checking in, I was early and the room was not ready yet. The lady at the check out counter was super friendly and got me checked in as soon as she was able. The only improvement I can offer is changing the shower head to new efficient shower head for better water pressure."
Chicago South Loop Hotel,"Had a great and comfortable stay Staff was excellent, very friendly. Great view of the city from the 5th floor Could have been a little cleaner but overall not bad"

Hampton Inn Chicago McCormick Place,"Comfortable Stay Room was spacious and comfortable. Hotel has a Starbucks below it and is close to eating places and a mini market. Staff were friendly and accommodating, especially Luis at the Front Desk and Ashley at the Breakfast room. Breakfast could do a little bit more as to food choices/options."
Hampton Inn Chicago McCormick Place,"Very Good Excellent hotel location if you need McCormick convention center or Wintrust arena. The staff is excellent. An example of exceptional kindness and courtesy of the staff is Miss Ta'Quana. The only small complaint about this hotel is the poor offer for breakfast, at least by European standards. There is no salad at all, the selection of fruit is poor. The only small complaint about this hotel is the poor offer for breakfast, at least by European standards.

Hampton Inn Chicago McCormick Place,"Perfect for events at McCormick Center - amazing staff Staff was amazing, breakfast was very good, bed comfortable, location super convenient for our convention, nearby restaurants were good. Pool was nice. Snack kiosk was out of stock/ out of order. Would have appreciated vending machines on the floors. Tapping key in elevator was awkward. Place scanner higher up and on both sides. Microwave in room would be a plus."
Hampton Inn Chicago McCormick Place,I experienced a couple hiccups but overall great hotel great location! Will stay again! The location was good! Their parking is only paid but doesn’t give that info on the site. Also I was not informed upon check-in that the rooms were only housekept every other day. Even after requesting my room to have housekeeping I came back and nothing had been done.
Hampton Inn Chicago McCormick Place,A good hotel for work Love the waffles at breakfast! Good location if you have to attend events at the McCormick Convention Center. Sometimes the shower water would take some time to heat up. But small thing.
Hampton Inn Chicago McCormick Place,Great room Location
Hampton Inn Chicago McCormick Place,"Good hotel if you are attending an event at the McCormick Center Convenient location. It is connected to the McCormick Convention Center, Chinatown for the food and close enough to Michigan Av. It also has a laundromat and breakfast spread was decent Could have provided more complimentary drinks and snacks daily for the price we paid for the rooms."
Embassy Suites Chicago - Downtown River North,"A reasonably price hotel that’s good for family stays. It was central, near shops and restaurants. The way the hotel was laid out was very unusual, like cruise ship cabins. I’ve had better breakfasts."
Embassy Suites Chicago - Downtown River North,Good Staff Cold
Embassy Suites Chicago - Downtown River North,"City break - Size of the room
- How close it was to everything

Embassy Suites Chicago - Downtown River North,"Great place to stay in central Chicago The room space was excellent - good segregation between area, and good space.

Staff throughout very friendly and helpful, particularly at breakfast - went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed.

Location is good, close to most interesting areas. The snacks at the afternoon were a bit average, not particularly exciting. Slow drinks service too, often only one person on the bar at the start of the session - fine after the initial rush.

Fitness centre a bit tired, though good range of equipment."
Embassy Suites Chicago - Downtown River North,"For Bears game Very nice location. Close to a lot of restaurants. Easy access for Uber pick-up. Water pressure in the shower was low. At night, there is a lot of noise from the parking garage and alley."
Hampton Inn & Suites Chicago-Downtown,"Everything was fantastic! Super friendly helpful awesome staff!
At the front desk she heard me talking that we slept terrible on the train on the way in. Got us a rear room. Did not hear one siren at night and slept great. Beds and bedding were awesome, quiet AC/heat. QUIET rooms all around! I didn’t hear anyone in the hall, didn’t hear city street noise, I slept like a log! Great breakfast too! Open 6-10AM!! Amazing."
Hampton Inn & Suites Chicago-Downtown,The location was perfect and was walking distance to everything. Great location N/A
Hampton Inn & Suites Chicago-Downtown,It was acceptable. Breakfast was not very appealing and NOTHING like the photos they use. The bed was a bit hard. Not Close to downtown The bed was uncomfortable. Very hard. The wall paper was peeling from the bathroom wall at the bottom and the door looked like it had water damage. The breakfast wasn’t the best. The fruit was rotted.

Lacking appliances—no coffee
machine."
Hyatt Place Chicago/Downtown - The Loop,"Nice, but not my jam. The staff was delightful and answered all our questions. When my son went into the hotel with our bags one of the staff asked if he had accommodations with the hotel and asked him to produce a key. Then escorted him to the elevators. The breakfast, which I paid extra for, was very good. The eggs were especially delicious. There is no parking close by. You have to park in a garage on the next corner and pay to park there. There were items broken and missing from the room. We called to get extra blankets and a pillow for the pull out bed and they took an hour to get them to us."
Hyatt Place Chicago/Downtown - The Loop,Very Good The location Poor breakfast

Homewood Suites By Hilton Chicago Downtown South Loop,"Great location, but unable to purchase something as simple as water was disappointing Location Unable to buy water for the entire stay"
Homewood Suites By Hilton Chicago Downtown South Loop,"Wonderful Good place in downtown Chicago, quiet.
Nice big room with kitchen and good lighting near the sink The breakfast was poor, lacking vegetables and cheese.
The bathtub only had control over the water temperature and not the flow rate."
Homewood Suites By Hilton Chicago Downtown South Loop,"Very pleasant stay with a beautiful view, close to the lake and park My recent stay at Homewood Suites by Hilton in the South Loop area of Chicago was very enjoyable. The hotel has a great location — close to downtown, the park, and the lakefront, where you can walk and enjoy views of the city.

The room was spacious, clean, and well-equipped. I got a room on the 17th floor with a beautiful city view, and in the morning I could see the sunrise over Lake Michigan — truly memorable!

The staff was friendly and helpful. Special thanks to the young woman who checked me in late on August 18 — she was very kind, cheerful, and welcoming.

The pool is small, but warm and perfect for relaxing after a long day. The breakfast was very basic, just the minimum and not very healthy! Personally, it was enough for a quick snack, but it felt more like a 2-star hotel breakfast in Europe, not what I’d expect from Hilton. There were no vegetables at all, and the only fruits available were apples and sometimes bananas. The most disappointing part was the use of plastic plates and cutlery. While other countries are fighting plastic waste and have already banned plastic straws, here, during one breakfast, the staff took out several bags of plastic tableware! It was such a terrible sight!

Additionally, I was charged a $525 deposit (for 7 nights), even though Booking.com listed it as €75 for the entire stay. However, the money was returned to my card quickly.

The mattress was full of lumps. There was no proper blanket, just a few thin sheets. The air conditioner was very noisy and hard to figure out how it works. When I turned it off, it would turn back on by itself.

These were just some of my observations, but overall, the room was good. I had a pleasant stay."
Homewood Suites By Hilton Chicago Downtown South Loop,Loved the view from my room better service would have been nice when needing more towels and too Location and the view of Lake Michigan Front desk could have been more helpful and they should clean the washers out because they were filthy. Would be nice to have more ways to buy water or something to drink .
Homewood Suites By Hilton Chicago Downtown South Loop,"Wonderful Location, cleanliness and pool and breakfast. I stay here often, when I come we never seem to be able to get a late check out. I can only guess it's because of the season. They have a nice location and staff is friendly."
Homewood Suites By Hilton Chicago Downtown South Loop,Wonderful Very good hotel near many attractions

But you can store your luggage, of course."

HI Chicago Hostel,Awesome!! Like terminator said I’ll be back !! I like ping pong table and pool table and open kitchen concept but pool table sticks where broken I like it a lot Cafecito place next to you and may be 24hours it’ll be great ! Because we’re tourists we were out all day and we go to sleep you need breakfast and dinner but in night time there is no place closer to eat I hope this help to improve your place perhaps a play station next to tv or movie nights Pool sticks where broken and ball 14 was missing in one of pool tables
HI Chicago Hostel,Exceptional Location was perfect and cost of living was within the budget. Washrooms needs a bit cleaning otherwise everything was perfect there.
HI Chicago Hostel,One of best stay and with good pricing Location was perfect. Very close to the Lake area and subway as well. Nothing.

Travelodge by Wyndham Downtown Chicago,Very Good Great location Aged building
Travelodge by Wyndham Downtown Chicago,"Very Good The room was huge and the beds were very comfortable. I would stay again.

Travelodge by Wyndham Downtown Chicago,"overall for the price that you pay it’s worth the money and it could be hard to find someting similar with reasonable pr Location is perfect, close to city center, subway, shops and restaurants. Around the building lots of parking lots with different pricing, never had a problem with finding a spot. As other reviewers stated this hotel facilities are quite old and used, but it didn’t bothered us that much everything was functional and working, the staff was very attentive and helpful but could be a little bit more nice."
Travelodge by Wyndham Downtown Chicago,Good overall Nice and comfortable The room didn’t have a city view as shown in pictures
Travelodge by Wyndham Downtown Chicago,"Pleasant Easy in and out of city. We were on the 12th floor, had this loud sound that came thru the walls like a machine was running, extremely loud and unbearable at times. Other than that great spot."
Travelodge by Wyndham Downtown Chicago,Very Good Location Crowd space
Congress Plaza Hotel Chicago,The staff was very nice and made you feel at home. Everyone greeted us entering and exiting the building. They even ask It is in a good location. Close to things we were doing I would have liked to have a better view outside. The room was stuffy and we had to kept the fan on all the time

Very nice gentleman at luggage storage. Bathrooms need a major Reno! Old fixtures; chipped tiles; poor water pressure."
Congress Plaza Hotel Chicago,Great for a quick overnight stay! Easy access to everything! Rock hard bed that was basically like sleeping on the floor!
Congress Plaza Hotel Chicago,"Hotel older, in need. Location close to our concert at the Auditorium Theatre. Restaurants within walking distance. TV in room was small and did not have hdtv. Hard to watch. Shower pressure was a little weak."
Congress Plaza Hotel Chicago,I tried for a voucher due the hot water not working.The hot water went out while in the shower around 8am. Went downstai The staff was nice The outlet locations. The outdated tub.
Congress Plaza Hotel Chicago,Polite service in a hotel needing upgrades The hotel is conveniently located across the street from the marathon finish line. We couldn’t get reservations for race day unfortunately. The plumbing was bad-toilet kept running. The shower ran cold. The room was cold. They do provide extra blankets and a space heater upon request.
Congress Plaza Hotel Chicago,Very Good It was convenient to everywhere I needed to go
Congress Plaza Hotel Chicago,"Historical hotel with beautiful architecture Gorgeous property and the hotel bar had amazing staff - didn’t use any other amenities. 10 minute walk to cloud gate - great location!

Congress Plaza Hotel Chicago,"Great room in a perfect location, was ideal for my needs as a lone marathoner Perfect location for the marathon and exploring Chicago Very large and impersonal, didn’t feel it was very friendly, unlike my experiences elsewhere in Chicago"
Congress Plaza Hotel Chicago,Excellent city centre location old world charm Location Bathroom old & outdated - sink was blocking after every use !
The Study at the University of Chicago,"I needed an accommodation during my husband’s surgery and hospital stay after that. The Study is only a ten minute walk The convenient location from the hospital. The area was patrolled and watched by the security guards and police cars. I felt pretty safe to walk back to my hotel even after dark.
Morning tea and coffee at the lobby was comforting on the cold winter morning. Nothing"
The Study at the University of Chicago,"I needed an accommodation during my husband’s hospital stay. It is only10 minutes walk from the hospital. The hotel gave Clean, friendly and conveniently located. The interior is very stylish and comfortable. The lobby has a n air of spacious library where you can spend hours reading and writing."
The Study at the University of Chicago,"Very Good Very clean, attention to detail in decor, comfortable rooms Parking"
The Study at the University of Chicago,"New and clean hotel right on campus at UChicago. Value for money. Location, right on campus. Clean and new. I did not like the bedding. Would be happier if a down comforter is provided."
The Study at the University of Chicago,"Overall good stay if you’re planning to be around the U of Chicago area. The hotel is next to Harris Policy School and i It was very pretty and modern We had to change rooms because the thermostat wasnt working and the new room had a super noisy ac. There was this guy, Rudy from maintenance, 10/10. Super kind and helpful. There was also a woman from the service desk that helped us switch rooms, she was also great. The other men at the reception weren’t helpful nor kind, they kind of seemed to ignore guests."
The Study at the University of Chicago,"Perfect location for visiting UChicago The restaurant on site was very good. The leather chair and ottoman were so lovely to have in the room and made the stay very comfortable. The room was well appointed, comfy bed, love the views and desk by the window. There was nothing I didn’t like."
The Study at the University of Chicago,Wonderful At the heart of UChicago and very convenient to visit my student.

The Study at the University of Chicago,Exceptional Everything Could be strength machines in exercise room
The Study at the University of Chicago,Wonderful Great and super friendly staff.
The Emily Hotel,"Great hotel in Chicago Nice, clean and in a very good neighbourhood
Rooms are spacious and overall very comfortable. M&G products in the shower are a great touch! Rather pricey and none of the bars/restaurants were available due to numerous private events. Sort of defeats the purpose of hotel bar/restaurant"
The Emily Hotel,"Exceptional It is very close to the L trains, and the staff on Thursday evening warmly welcomed me. The interior of the hotel is probably one of the best among the boutique hotels in town! The room was very clean and comfortable, and there was a very cute little radio in the room."
The Emily Hotel,"Great hotel definitely stay again Great staff, excellent location Nothing"
The Emily Hotel,Great stay of you wish to be in a place where there are great restaurants! Great location Was noisy on Friday night plus AC was loud
The Emily Hotel,Exceptional Location 
The Emily Hotel,"Convenient location and nice rooms. The rooms were beautiful, bathrooms were accessible and good water pressure in the shower. Very convenient location to the venue where we were attending a concert. Walkable area with a CVS, McDonalds, Train station, and Duncan Donuts nearby. The valet and staff were fantastic. The 2 rooms I booked together were on different floors, there was no free breakfast which I have grown accustomed to at other hotels. 80 a night for parking is a bit steep as well. I also didn't like the abundance of alcohol left in the mini bar. I was traveling with 20 year-olds who didn't need to be around that."
The Emily Hotel,Wonderful Located in a great neighborhood across the street from Google. Small coffee shop with limited menu and seating is the only breakfast option in the hotel.
The Emily Hotel,"Great place to stay! Stayed in several places on our trip and this was by far the best. Great location, lovely room and great staff The fierce aircon in the public areas"
The Emily Hotel,"Great hotel in the West Loop, a little out of the way for daytime tourist stuff The hotel is in a fun area where people come to go out to dinner. We went to the movies on the roof at night. Very fun! Big lobby and a coffee place at hotel. Liked the room a lot. I read other reviews that the rooms were basic but ours had soft carpet and a big bathroom and a king bed. Was great. It’s out of the way for touristy stuff. I don’t like to stay right in the tourist or downtown area but this was prob a little too far. The hotel seems like is where tech companies and twentysomethings live. It’s nice to see and come have dinner but no need to hang out there for longer than a day. I felt like I had to go out and stay out all day and only come home at the end of the day."
The Emily Hotel,Exceptional We loved the modern minimalist vibe of the decor. The service and amenities of the hotel were excellent! Enjoyed the rooftop movie night on the hotel roof. (Definitely check it out if you are there in the summer). The location is great for restaurants and touring downtown sites. Highly recommend! Everything was excellent.
citizenM Chicago Downtown,"Exceptional As always CitizenM are superb. You could not ask for a better location. I had a king room with a view and the views were stunning, the majority of nights we stayed in and just watched the world go by. Staff were really lovely. This will be the 3rd CitizenM we've stayed in and it will continue to be our go to hotel because of its friendly atmosphere and amazing amenities. Nothing"
citizenM Chicago Downtown,Good location Friendly Digital check in Small occupancy
citizenM Chicago Downtown,"Fun and cozy refuge in the heart of Chicago Staff kind, common spaces functional and fun, nice view, well-thought room, functional, clean. Loved the tablet to control everything. The room was a bit too small."
citizenM Chicago Downtown,"Wonderful comfortable room & cozy lounge, downtown Chicago"
citizenM Chicago Downtown,Nice This is the 3rd time staying here good Wending machine for coffee free of cost for room mates good especially winter can be kept in restaurant
citizenM Chicago Downtown,I felt very safe and comfortable. There was always someone around to assist me The art of as so beautiful! Absolutely nothing. It was amazing
citizenM Chicago Downtown,"I loved the hotel! 10/10 stay! If I traveled to Chicago again this would be my stay again! The property was beautiful! The area and views were beautiful! The room was modern with great amenities and technology. Comfy, cozy and clean! If you have a vehicle parking is a bit far. The shower in the room didn’t have great temperature."
citizenM Chicago Downtown,"I’ll be back. Fun, funky vibe. Very clean. Great location. A couple of staff members were kind of rude but the other friendly and helpful staff members completely made up for that. The tiny rooms without coffee makers aren’t for everyone but suited me fine."
citizenM Chicago Downtown,It was very good The location and the hotel in general I think the bed can be more comfortable
citizenM Chicago Downtown,Wonderful Great location comfy lounge friendly staff Asked for room cleaning and never done. Overall great experience.
Hyatt Regency McCormick Place Chicago,"All in all a positive experience, the new renovation may make the experience better next time and would stay here again. The close proximity to soldier field. Easy to get to and from interstate. The room we stayed in had a beautiful city and lake view. However we were told the rooms were being renovated. Which were in need of upgrades. Furniture was a bit tired and the bathrooms needed some paint maintenance etc. beds were comfortable as were the pillows. The cost was too high for the quality of the room we stayed in."
Hyatt Regency McCormick Place Chicago,Very Good Great bed and linens! Super location for conference. Our room was two rooms over from the elevator and we could hear the elevator all night.
Hyatt Regency McCormick Place Chicago,Wonderful how close it was to food and entertainment
Hyatt Regency McCormick Place Chicago,Wonderful Very nice and clean Parking
Hyatt Regency McCormick Place Chicago,Only a short stay to ate4nd a concert at Soldier Field. Clean and comfortable room. 
Hyatt Regency McCormick Place Chicago,"Location ...Location....Location Check in and parking was a nightmare.
Parking garage was very confusing Parking"
Hyatt Regency McCormick Place Chicago,"Meals poor Location to activities we wanted to see. Price was good. Space was excellent. Beds comfortable. Six &Eight restaurant food was horrible! Flavor was off. Noodles not done, crunchy. Rice crunchy."
Hyatt Regency McCormick Place Chicago,"Overall it was a pleasant stay The hotel was very clean and comfortable. It had good food and coffee options. They were very busy, but check in was still quick & the elevators were fast and we didn’t have to wait for them. It was walking distance to soldier field which was great. The beds & pillows were very comfortable. A few things…
The place was huge and hard to navigate and had little signage or staff to assist. Initially I was told that parking fees vary due to the option that we pick. Because the main lot was full, we were directed to a 2nd lot that seemed far away so we expected that we were getting the least expensive lot but yet it still cost us the same $40 as the attached parking. Upon leaving, we were told that the parking fee is $40 regardless of which lot we were in, so why was I told differently before I checked in? Had we known that up front, we would have saved the aggravation & just spent the extra $20 for vallet.
Check out- I wasn’t given a thank you, “how was your stay?” Or any of the normal questions you’d expect.
We upgraded our room to a city view but aside from a small portion of the lake, the only view that we had was of the roof below us. The worst part of our stay was coming back from the concert. They rope off all of their lobby seating and every single option to get a drink (we were only looking for water) or a snack was fully closed and apparently they do dot even have vending machines to grab a coke or a water. There was a mean “bouncer like” person directing everyone to the elevators and just kept saying that everything is closed."
Hyatt Regency McCormick Place Chicago,"Overall, the stay was excellent. Tony checked me in and from there, everything was great! view, quiet, clean The line for coffee/breakfast was too long for hours during the volleyball tournament.
A separate line to pay for the grab & go food would have been great. I just wanted a yogurt and sandwich from the frig, but had to stand in line for 20 minutes to pay for it."
Hyatt Regency McCormick Place Chicago,Had a great time with my daughter and granddaughter Proximity to venue All good
La Quinta by Wyndham Chicago Downtown,Very Good The location was perfect for attending a Broadway musical and walk to the other places we visited. The staff was friendly and courteous. I was unhappy that as a paying guest we were charged per bag to hold our bags. I have never experienced this during my stay at other hotel chains.
La Quinta by Wyndham Chicago Downtown,"Rugby union weekend, needed a bar for gatherings Location No bar"

La Quinta by Wyndham Chicago Downtown,Wonderful Location Comfortable and friendly staff.
La Quinta by Wyndham Chicago Downtown,"Nice big rooms great location but disappointed about our thin not being traced. Location Unable to contact property on phone easily.
Left our toiletries behind but called right away after we left the hotel and the front desk and housekeeping did not return the items which included a sonicare toothbrush."
La Quinta by Wyndham Chicago Downtown,Wonderful The location was perfect The staff was pushy and rushed you at breakfast. We had an 84 year old in our party who can't eat or move as fast as they'd like.
Swissotel Chicago,"Such a beautiful experience! Amazing views , wonderful staff !!!
I will be back again ❤️ No complaints"
Swissotel Chicago,"Very Good Very nice hotel. Quiet, well managed, nicely appointed rooms. High quality The water tastes terrible. And the available boxed water cost $6 for a small bottle. That is ridiculous. Given how bad the water from the tap tastes, they should make some better tasting water available for free."
Swissotel Chicago,"Beautiful view and comfortable hotel! The Swissotel location is very convenient. The room has a beautiful view! It is also clean and quiet. The bed is comfortable, and the bathroom is clean with a nice bathtub. Towels are nice too. The gym is on the 43rd floor! It has an amazing view of downtown Chicago and Lake Michigan. The front desk receptionist, Rachel, is super helpful! Not much to complain about!"
Swissotel Chicago,"Nice views, room ok Nice views to the river, 18th floor A/C takes a while to turn off and on"
Swissotel Chicago,You will not regret Location Facilities Cleanliness Nothing
Swissotel Chicago,"Wonderful we upgraded to a higher room with a better view and that was worth the extra money, the room was close to the elevators and was a bit noisier than we would have like, the location was great, right next to the river and we had a view of navy pier room was upgraded but next to the elevators, and even though we paid for breakfast we were still charged a small amount for the breakfast"
Swissotel Chicago,Comfortable hotel with some amazing views Location a d views from the room More bussiness like environment and not holiday like
Swissotel Chicago,"Good value and location. Would recommend and plan future visits Nice views, nice gym with 43 floor views, great room, eco friendly hotel, 12:00 noon check out. No pool"
Swissotel Chicago,Exclusive place in the city center An exclusive place to stay just in the absolute center of Chicago. Nothing to complain. We just stayed one night. Didn't use any facilities. 20-25 minutes walk from train station taking you directly to the airport (not disatvantage - just information)
Swissotel Chicago,"Fantastic location and views. We got upgraded to a suite - which was absolutely fantastic. Huge amount of space, views across the river and the city, probbaly one of the nicest rooms I've ever stayed in.

Hotel elevator worked really well - often in these big hotels, there is a lot of slowness and standing around - not here, the call system was clever and worked really well.

Location was excellent, pretty close for us to walk to Grant Park for the Marathon. Also highly appreciated pasta party and early breakfast options. The breakfast part of the package was shambolic. I was told at one point ""you $35 complimentary breakfast is in that area"".
Staff seemed unable to articulate whether breakfast was free, whether it was credit based, or how much credit we had. Really odd for something so basic.

They were friendly and helpful and removed the charges, but seemed bizarrely hard to get a clear answer."
"Club Quarters Hotel Central Loop, Chicago","I would stay here again Location is great: steps to Chicago Board of Trade, Rookery building, Marquette Building, walking distant to pretty much everything in downtown. Close to subway, buses, food court. My room was so tucked away and quiet I could not hear a nip of neighbours. Wifi is great. Clean. You can pair up your own devices, but there is no streaming platforms available. It was Thanksgiving and I could see the rooms were available that very same day for much cheaper than I was paying, I wad sooo mad."
"Club Quarters Hotel Central Loop, Chicago",Very good Location was perfect . I went to Sting concert and spent only 15 minutes by foot Small room

"Club Quarters Hotel Central Loop, Chicago","Comfortable stay and great location Comfortable bed, friendly staff and smooth check-in process.
The location is fantastic, just around the corner from Jackson Station which is on the blue line train from O'Hare airport. The room had everything we needed and the hotel is in a quiet and safe location. Our room on the 6th floor was very stuffy (windows do not open) and the air conditioning didn't really help with cooling the room that much, but as we were out of the room a lot, this was only a minor issue."
"Club Quarters Hotel Central Loop, Chicago","Great stay! Great location, wonderful staff, bed was comfortable and room was clean. It's a minor thing but got a little annoying over time - The wait for Elevators for floors 7-10 was ridiculously long."
"Club Quarters Hotel Central Loop, Chicago","Wonderful Water bottles in the hallway are a nice touch. Location was great. Elevators a tiny bit slow, but if that’s the only issue it’s probably a good sign"
"Club Quarters Hotel Wacker at Michigan, Chicago","Safe, value for money, touristy, simple. Great for solo travel, smack bang in the middle of everything you want downtown Chicago, also so easy to get to a Blackhawks game."

"Club Quarters Hotel Wacker at Michigan, Chicago","Wonderful Great location, very comfortable room"
"Club Quarters Hotel Wacker at Michigan, Chicago",It was okay. Proximity to river and excellent dining options. The elevators were non functional and we had to use the stairs…. From the 23rd floor….
"Club Quarters Hotel Wacker at Michigan, Chicago","Very Good Good location,"
"Club Quarters Hotel Wacker at Michigan, Chicago","Very Good A little outdated furnishings imho. Looking at the online photos, I was disappointed by the actual dated look. A refresh would be nice"
"Club Quarters Hotel Wacker at Michigan, Chicago","Great location, close to lots of restaurants and sightseeing experiences. We loved the location; accessible to everything we wanted to do. The staff were super friendly and helpful. Free coffee facilities on the 2nd floor, in addition to coffee in our room. The chilled water bottles by the lift was a nice touch. The bed was really comfortable! A safety deposit box and a fridge would have been useful."

Best Western Chicago Downtown-River North,"Overall good but not great The room was big and comfortable but the elevators, hallways, etc looked like they needed a renovation The hallways and elevator"
Best Western Chicago Downtown-River North,"This was our third time there and always a pleasure to be there, just the elevator is a problem. Love the staff and give Downtown Chicago where you can get to anywhere very easily and in walking distance.. The elevator were broken and wasn’t told that we could the middle elevator to the fourth floor and walk up two more flights of stairs, with heavy suitcases, to the last room at the end of the hallway by the other (SW) stairway.. Also changed the smoking area to be nonexistented! It needs to be brought back if possible. Thanks"
Best Western Chicago Downtown-River North,Better than expected. A great value for the price. Would recommend to a friend! The room was surprisingly spacious for a big city hotel. The pool was clean and the kids loved it. Parking was a little pricey but convenient as we were on a road trip.
Best Western Chicago Downtown-River North,"Excellent location and price! Will stay again!! Location was great for walking around the city. Kids loved the pool. Great value for its location. Clean room, friendly staff. Fridge would have been good."
Hyatt Place Chicago Medical/University District,"Good, but Parking security sucks It was great! This was our second time here! The security at the parking lot had me get out of my car in the pouring rain at night to show her my parking pass before I was allowed back in. What’s the point of me writing down my license plate # and make and model of the car when I pay for parking, if it’s not checked to prevent this from having had happened."
Hyatt Place Chicago Medical/University District,"Newly renovated hotel within walking distance to United Center Spacious room with couch and large TV, quiet, comfortable bed, convenient location for United Center, reasonably priced on site easy access parking lot. Newly refurbished. Room was a bit dark even with all the lights on (it was a dreary overcast day so little natural light from the one small window). Wide hallways and external key card elevator operation a bit different. Not much walkable in terms of restaurants."
Hyatt Place Chicago Medical/University District,Exceptional Excellent location and place was quiet. Can be little liberal with coffee and free water bottles in the lobby.
Hyatt Place Chicago Medical/University District,Exceptional Very clean. Parking
Hyatt Place Chicago Medical/University District,Excellent Everything was nice and clean

Central Loop Hotel,Wonderful Customer Service was excellent when checking in All good
Central Loop Hotel,Good Loop Hotel Great location y really Nice staff. TV was not working
Central Loop Hotel,Very nice hotel in a great location I would recommend to anyone It was in a great location near everywhere central very easy to commute from I couldn’t pick a better location Nothing
Central Loop Hotel,"Great hotel, good location, nice staff, but some very tiny rooms. Wonderful location, between the railroad station and the waterfront. It’s very clean, has water filling stations, washer/dryers for guests to use without charge, and generous check in and out policies. We stayed twice within three weeks. Our first room was the smallest hotel room I’ve ever stayed in, and very tight for two people. When we stayed the 2nd time, the room was twice the size, and had a fridge and microwave. It was very comfortable."
Central Loop Hotel,I enjoyed my stay there and will definitely return and recommend the hotel to my family and friends The location was terrific. I had a street view room which I loved.There was a water station on every floor with plastic water bottles provided. The room was spacious and comfortable. There was a mini fridge and a microwave in the room. The shower big enough for two with good water pressure. There was a noise coming from the vent which made it difficult to sleep some nights.
Central Loop Hotel,Good choice and good value. Location is great for train and theater.
Central Loop Hotel,Great location! The location is great. Very close to train stations and you can walk pretty much to any touristic site from there. If you don’t like to walk there is also a bike station where you can rent/return the bike or scooter if you feel like touring around with it. I thought the room would be a little bigger and the mattress was too soft for me and my husband.
Central Loop Hotel,Nice staff Convenient location None
Central Loop Hotel,"Good stay but always room for improvement. The room was clean, had all basic items needed for my stay and breakfast was good as well. I would just advise different breakfast options that do not include diary. The rooms came with a coffee maker but no free pods or any tea bags. I wish the room had come with some tea and basic items to make it like sugar or honey. I also wish there was a sign about how you need to obtain water at a filling station outside the room. I would much rather have a complimentary bottle of water in the room or a sign about the water. I also would have liked a sign in the room about the wifi and how to get access."
Central Loop Hotel,"A great choice in Chicago Super clean, super quiet, super comfortable. No breakfast -- but no big deal."
River Hotel,Wonderful The view 
River Hotel,"Best value for money - very practical Practical, drinking water fountain in corridor, free washing machines, full equipped kitchenette
Not posh, but clean and practical No breakfast option"
River Hotel,"Wonderful The hotel location is excellent. The room is well equipped, except for the kitchen, which didn't have drinking glasses."
River Hotel,My go to place when in Chicago. Perfect location for me to get to work. Things in the area were conveniently walking distance. The gym on site was perfect along with laundry. Perfect.
River Hotel,Very Good I like the location.
River Hotel,Very Good Great location. Free coffee. Helpful staff
River Hotel,"Great location; close to everything, wonderful staff great viees vomfy bed and great coffee machine on 2nd floor The location is excellent; so many excellent steakhouses nearby as well as River North neighborhood right across the bridge and so close to all the shops on N. Michigan Ave Stayed here 30 yrs ago for the view and it did not disappoint once again. Only wish they’d update the rooms already! But the beds are extremely comfy. Thank u to Ronnie. The SWEETEST, most hospitable and accommodating front desk clerk I’ve ever met! Until next time
Patrice Lack of updating bathrooms and carpeting in rooms"
River Hotel,"Given any small criticism, the River Hotel was great and a good value for it’s prime location The location was perfect. It was central to everything I wanted to do. I do wish that a simple breakfast of coffee, juice and fruit/pastries was included. The staff were so friendly and helpful. I would have appreciated a refrigerator in room. There wasn’t a restaurant. I understand that may be not profitable but something should be done with the space, given the lobby is small."
River Hotel,We will be back Great lace and great location
River Hotel,"Highly recommend this hotel! Great location, good size room, comfortable bed and great staff No bar or restaurant"
"Claridge House Chicago, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",Excellent location in Gold Coast Location 
"Claridge House Chicago, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",Nice hotel and location Location
"Claridge House Chicago, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",Really good overall It was nice. Clean and comfortable The elevator broke down and the stairs where a pain the day we checked out with our luggage
"Claridge House Chicago, Tapestry Collection by Hilton","Cozy Very quaint hotel! The staff was really kind and friendly. Lovely bar/breakfast area where we got acai bowls and coffee every morning. The area is really nice, lots of brick surrounding and felt cozy in general. The room was smaller than I anticipated, including the bathroom. The room was pretty basic with the bed, a small fridge thankfully, and a TV. We got used to it, but there's minimal space to hang your clothes and a bit tight in the bathroom. We had a nice view of the neighboring buildings and city though! Also there's a hotel fee where you can apply $10 to drinks/food daily which I guess worked out when we ate every morning?"
"Claridge House Chicago, Tapestry Collection by Hilton","Wonderful It was fantastic! The hotel staff is very dedicated to improving your stay.
They absolutely went above and beyond and must be commended.
The hotel is well located in a safe area and not too far away from attractions *not walking distance at night.
Building is well equipped, comfy, pleasing to the eyes.
Complimentary drink and in-room coffee machine, adds a vacation and convenience feel. For the price payed for two nights, it could very well have offer at least a small breakfast as well, or some sort of option in this regard."
"Claridge House Chicago, Tapestry Collection by Hilton","A great location in Chicago Very good view from the room and comfortable equipment. Quiet and pleasant location, close to the underground and the Lincoln park. There is no proper breakfast but you can go to a bagel restaurant next door which is really good."
"Claridge House Chicago, Tapestry Collection by Hilton","Very Good Great location, just near the city center. Comfortable bed, friendly personal."
"Claridge House Chicago, Tapestry Collection by Hilton","Very Good The location and general feel of the hotel was great. Although the amenity fee was described ahead of time, I would have preferred to have the option to exclude this. I didn't like hearing that Hyatt is in the process of purchasing the hotel. Anticipated price increases will likely prevent from us from returning."
"Claridge House Chicago, Tapestry Collection by Hilton","Wonderful Bed was very comfortable. Staff was very pleasant Bathroom was very small
Coffeemaker in room did not work properly"
"Claridge House Chicago, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",2 out of 3 of the bartenders where awesome. It had a wonderful smell when entering and very clean. The toilet in the handicap room was a low toilet. Toilets need upgraded to comfort height.
Crowne Plaza - Chicago West Loop by IHG,"We slept very well. I had a car and was very happy to have found a booking that included parking. Bathroom should have doors that close. The barn door style on a bathroom is disgusting and bad. Tub had a big crack the cleaning staff could not have missed, so the building is not getting the repairs it needs."
Crowne Plaza - Chicago West Loop by IHG,Great. Would stay again! Location. Ease of check in.
Crowne Plaza - Chicago West Loop by IHG,"Very Good The staff was so welcoming and informative of the area and city all together. Everyone was very friendly and accommodating! This isn't really on the hotel, this is the new hotel culture. Having to say how often you want cleaned up and items restocked. You're so used to it automatically being done in the past, you sort of expect it, but again...not on the hotel. You will have to let staff know."
Crowne Plaza - Chicago West Loop by IHG,"Recommended The coffee shop, food is all delicious
The surroundings, many choices of restaurants
Hotel is near to the bus station A bit too far to downtown"
Crowne Plaza - Chicago West Loop by IHG,"Great, highly recommend Good location, clean, comfortable and helpful staff Gap in bathroom door"
Crowne Plaza - Chicago West Loop by IHG,Overall a great stay. Close to Inited Center. Easy parking. Lobby could be updated. Small chairs could be placed on balcony.
Crowne Plaza - Chicago West Loop by IHG,"Reasonably priced and comfortable hotel in a nice little area of Chicago. Well lit and spacious rooms, comfortable beds. Good location for access to dining, etc….. (but too close to the hwy) Highway noise!
I was super tired so managed to fall asleep, but it really is loud. If you’re sensitive to that, bring a sound machine."
Crowne Plaza - Chicago West Loop by IHG,Overall a great place to stay within walking distance of metro Centrally located for our various family events - welcoming - very clean - good breakfasts Much waiting for the lifts
Crowne Plaza - Chicago West Loop by IHG,"Very Good Great location, comfortable bed, nice lobby Staff not so friendly at front desk. Garbage pails by the elevator in the lobby filled to the brim. Not a good show."
Crowne Plaza - Chicago West Loop by IHG,"Wonderful Excellent staff and very good breakfast.

Best Western Grant Park Hotel,"The location was great, the staff were great. The location was great, the staff were great. the bathroom was very clean but could benefit from a fresh coat of paining."
Best Western Grant Park Hotel,Good Location
Best Western Grant Park Hotel,"Great stay, highly recommend! Very comfortable, nice pillow and bed. They changed the sheets during our short stay, very clean. NOTHING to do with the property, but the door slamming of other guests was loud."
Best Western Grant Park Hotel,"Very Good The location was perfect for our purposes. Convenient to reach public transportation and much to do within easy walking distance. The room was comfortable and had adequate space, lighting, and outlets. Temperature control worked well. Room was serviced daily. Friendly helpful staff."
Best Western Grant Park Hotel,"Lovely location, close to park and amenities. Location great. Staff nice. Room comfy/clesn No decaf ;-)"
Best Western Grant Park Hotel,"Nice cozy hotel, great location and decent price Great location, comfortable and cozy room, spacious room, friendly staff, attached French bakery with delicious pastries/coffee and 10% discount for hotel guests.

We would like to thank the hotel for assigning us a corner room, which had a set of windows along the walls and allowed us to enjoy the amazing view of the downtown buildings and Lake Michigan. We stayed for a week and truly enjoyed our room. No microwave in the room.
No laundry service (that seems to be a downtown Chicago issue, not this hotel specifically), there’s no laundry service around, so plan accordingly or use app."
Best Western Grant Park Hotel,"Good Location, staff were friendly & very helpful. Thank you for a great visit! Hot water in room 318 fluctuated regularly, and was never ""hot"". The shower base is not fully enclosed so water from the curtain drips down out onto the washroom floor in a pool on towels. We understood it was a handicap access shower but this could be a big potential slip hazard.

Unfortunately the air con unit near the window leaked onto the carpet our whole stay.

We mentioned both areas to the front desk who said they would be attended to while we were out.

They offered to switch the room, but we declined as we thought the areas could get fixed. We tried our best to avoid the carpet on one side of the room.

My only recommendation would be to follow up with the guests to inform about the maintenance visit outcome"
Best Western Grant Park Hotel,Ideal location. I was attending the rugby game at Soldier Field and the hotel was ideally located. Additionally there were plenty of restaurants and bars in the immediate neighbourhood where supporters mingled. There were also parks and other tourist attractions within walking distance. Staff were courteous and helpful. Very little. I was aware of the traffic noise from the nearby Michigan Ave. but it wasn't an issue.
Best Western Grant Park Hotel,Valet definitely ruined this trip Location valet was very rude and unprofessional. You pay 58 dollars to have in and out privileges and ever time we needed our car it was a problem or issue. House keeping never came we had to hunt them down for towels
Best Western Grant Park Hotel,"Wonderful The staff was great, location, for me, was very convenient, it was clean and breakfast was good. I wrote a question and got an answer a day later, which was too late at that point. Nothing terrible but would have been amazing to have a quicker response."
"The Robey, Chicago, a Member of Design Hotels","Wonderful Loved the view, location, venue, bars, the staff. Really enjoyed everything. Only thing I'd say is the hold on the room charge to reimburse the money back to my card after checkout, but I understand it may take a few days."
"The Robey, Chicago, a Member of Design Hotels","One night stay- made very comfortable Location, clean, friendly, awesome neighborhood"
"The Robey, Chicago, a Member of Design Hotels",Exceptional How close it was to the venue we were attending and how easy check in and velet service was. Staff was very polite and friendly! No complaints
"The Robey, Chicago, a Member of Design Hotels",I will definitely stay at the Roby when I return to the area. Staff at check I. Were super nice and helpful. Always professional and welcoming.
"The Robey, Chicago, a Member of Design Hotels","Exceptional My best friend and I came up from Indy to enjoy the neighborhood for a couple days. Jose at the front reception was great! So nice and informative, really had our night starting off great! The rooms exceeded our expectations. The vibes, the window views, everything truly went perfect. We got to enjoy brunch at Cafe Robey and it was delicious! Highly recommend their biscuits and gravy. We also got to enjoy Le Labo just next door to the hotel, definitely should check out their Chicago limited scent. We had an amazing time, and staying at The Robey made is all the more fun!"
"The Robey, Chicago, a Member of Design Hotels","would stay here again in a heartbeat, fantastic views would stay here again, super nice and comfortable, great tacos on the roof when you need a snack location isn't my favorite in chicago, it's a bit sprawly, but still, it is walking distance to a few great places in wicker park, so it's on my list of top hotels to stay in for a short time"
"The Robey, Chicago, a Member of Design Hotels",Great! Highly recommended. Great location. Great amenities. The price
"The Robey, Chicago, a Member of Design Hotels","Comfortable, clean, stylish hotel perfect for local flavor. This was a very nice hotel if you wanted to experience a local vs super touristy part of Chicago. There were multiple restaurants and we liked the breakfast and the rooftop tacos. The staff was very friendly. There were TONS of nearby places to eat. Locally we mainly thrift shopped. Beds super comfortable. The trade off is it’s not super close to classic tourist sites."
"The Robey, Chicago, a Member of Design Hotels","Amazing staff, updated rooms, great nightlife on site Beautiful room and an awesome location We loved everything about it"
"The Robey, Chicago, a Member of Design Hotels",Exceptional close and convenient for where we were going and a lot of things are in walking distance.
Hyatt Place Chicago River North,Exceptional Too close the location what i want to go and peaceful To far to the from parking area and expensive hopefully your company will included the parking fee and hotel accommodation with or without
Hyatt Place Chicago River North,You can’t go wrong staying here. The customer service was amazing and so was the location.
Hyatt Place Chicago River North,Great stay at a very nice hotel and location in Chicago Location and clean rooms Nothing to comment
Hyatt Place Chicago River North,"Good stay but just FYI… The property had a modern look to it. The room was very clean upon arriving. The room had a fridge, tv, and very modern bathroom. The location made us feel very safe and it was close to many stores & all types of necessary locations that were all at a reasonable walking distance. Overall, I’d stay here again. It was nice and any complaints are just preference related that maybe others might care more for. Upon checking in, the receptionist was very nice however did not give us much info about where our room was. Pretty much just gave us our room keys with a number on it. Luckily we had the logic to use the first number of our room to find the floor we were on. There’s a restaurant that’s connected/part of the hotel that’s very loud during certain times. Making a main entrance to get to the “front desk” would be helpful. During our stay, one of the elevators was out of service which made wait time for one longer, so we just used the stairs. The hotel is also connected to another hotel that’s using the same building so we were told we go into marked doors that said the name of that other hotel and use their elevators, but we would end up in their lobby. So it didn’t quite make sense to us. In our king room (which you would think is one of their better suites), there was only a fridge. Would’ve been nice to include at least a microwave. No complimentary water (only for members) & only a coffee machine. THE TV KEPT HAVING ERRORS. At any channel, the cable tv would lag & freeze. And an error message would appear. It would be like for a good minute and occur every couple of minutes."
Hyatt Place Chicago River North,Exceptional Excellent location and very friendly staff. Our room was clean and spacious and the breakfast was nice with a good variety. There is a fire station across the street so there is often quite a lot noise on the lower floors from the incoming/outgoing fire engines. The hotel tries to mitigate this with earplugs and a noise canceller.
Hyatt Place Chicago River North,A beautiful experience with expert staff and terrific location The staff in particular. Everyone great and helpful. Marisol in particular was so gracious! Nothing
Hyatt Place Chicago River North,"Exceptional Great stay! Location exceeded expectations — lots to do around and walking distance to most attractions. Room was spacious, comfy, and clean. Breakfast hours are too limited, so it gets crowded. You need to go early to avoid stress. Food choices are limited and the setup is confusing."
Hyatt Place Chicago River North,Very Good Location to Riverwalk No parking or credit for parking
Hyatt Place Chicago River North,"It was a nice experience, staff were friendly, garage was a few blocks away and good breakfast. Even though we are a big Location NA"
Hyatt Place Chicago River North,Worthy Jess in the front desk was really nice all the time we were around! The breakfast was the best we’ve ever had. Thank you Santosi for the amazing experience! There was a nice lady working in the kitchen and she made my day with her joyful spirit! All fine.

Residence Inn by Marriott Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile,A Great Play to Stay confort
Residence Inn by Marriott Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile,"Very Good Great location
Stylish hotel Bedding was an issue. 2 sheets with a duvet in between does not make for a comfortable sleep. You end up tangled in the sheets and the duvet is then exposed.

The automated curtains makes it hard to get them where you want them. Our room looked directly into the bedroom of the room next door so you needed to keep the blinds partially closed."
Residence Inn by Marriott Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile,Staff was very friendly and the room was perfect for a little couples get away. Location
Residence Inn by Marriott Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile,Perfect location and convenient for family traveling with small kids. They let us do early check in which was so nice traveling with young kids. Breakfast was excellent and the staffs were professional and kind. Kids loved the stuffed animal toys they gave during check in. They also hold our luggage kindly. The location is perfect being on the main avenue of where we wanted to visit. We were so happy with our staying and we will definitely be coming back! The noise from outside. Just lots of sirens from the city.
Residence Inn by Marriott Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile,"Wonderful place to stay, clean, and close to everything! We loved the location! Just steps away from the Mag mile, and the loop! It was great!! The lobby was on the 20th floor… never saw that before."
Residence Inn by Marriott Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile,Exceptional everything
Residence Inn by Marriott Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile,"Everything was perfect other than hoping for full window view Everything was exceptional; however, I wish the booking details had been more specific about the city view type. I originally booked a city view hoping for floor-to-ceiling windows, but I ended up with a small window and was told it was first come, first served. N/A"
Residence Inn by Marriott Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile,"Wonderful I love the location, right by Michigan Ave. And I actually stayed there before when it was the Conrad hotel years ago didn't realize until I got to my hotel room lol but the staff was super nice and the room was clean. I'll definitely be back."

Embassy Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile,"Good location Location was great, Like the breakfast and the snacks & beverage happy hour. I ended up paying $200 more in fees from initial rate confirmed on booking.com due additional hotel fees."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile,We stayed here for a girls weekend to go to American Girl Doll and shop. It was a wonderful stay with a great location a Great location and amenities. Comfortable and clean rooms and spaces- excellent for a group. Parking on site and the ability to drive up to drop off and pick up out of the elements was great. Good breakfast and the bar area was nice and lots of TVs and space to hang out. The destination fee was a little confusing and we ended up losing our $25 ($50 since we had 2 rooms) the first night since I didn’t really look into it and we got there late. Just felt like an additional unnecessary fee in my opinion.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile,Great city but hotel charges ridiculous The hotel is perfectly located and it is an amazing city I was overcharged by about £700 with no explanation given. When checking out the bill was confirmed but then when the receipt came through it was different
Embassy Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile,"Good Very central position.
The room was really big."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile,"Had a good stay, everyone was very attentive. The friendliness Having to pay the $200 resort fee and having to use $25 a day in the restaurant whether I wanted to or not. So $50 is not givin back out of the $200"
Embassy Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile,Good hotel just inconsiderate to have construction going on at 2 am Great location nice rooms There was noisy construction work going on in the building two consecutive nights (all night!) making it impossible to sleep.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile,"Great place, great price, very clean. Great location, nice clean rooms, easy access to everything downtown. The housekeeping just walked in after knocking two times, this was at 9am when check out isn't even until 11 am. They should try to do better about seeing if people have checked out before entering."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile,Very Good Only problem was seating at breakfast to Otherwise we love staying there
Embassy Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile,Wonderful Yes
Embassy Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile,"Very Good The location of the hotel, the neatness of the hotel and a very ample of space for the family as the kids really enjoyed themselves. The parking at the hotel was too pricey $$$"

Godfrey Hotel Chicago,Very Good Good location! Clean.
Godfrey Hotel Chicago,Beautiful facility and very helpful staff Very spacious rooms and bathroom Would have liked a microwave in our room
Godfrey Hotel Chicago,Wonderful I didn’t know till the end of stay that I needed to ask for a microwave to be in my room
Godfrey Hotel Chicago,"Enjoyable- would return Modern, clean- great location Poor service at bar. The bar on ground floor not the roof scape bar"
Godfrey Hotel Chicago,Great stay. Great location. Nice housekeeping service. Asked for a microwave and they delivered within minutes. Thin walls and windows. Lots of outside noise.
Godfrey Hotel Chicago,"Wonderful The room was great, and is likely the most well lit hotel room I've ever stayed in. The front desk provided fiji water bottles whenever we needed them which was really nice. The rooftop was amazing, the drinks were good, the DJ was great, the atmosphere and vibes were immaculate and thankfully the food was actually very good. The only complaint I have was the wifi was very weak, other than that it was a great experience. And even with this issue I would still stay at this hotel again in the future."
Godfrey Hotel Chicago,Wonderful Everything Nothing really
Le Meridien Essex Chicago,Exceptional The location The last day was not a discount for the breakfast
Le Meridien Essex Chicago,Very Good Hotel is lovely and modern. Staff were helpful They charged me twice For my stay- I did receive a refund but it took a couple of days to come through which meant I was $900 short
Le Meridien Essex Chicago,"Would definitely stay here again, Chitown is a great city. Very helpful staff, great location. Nice and well priced bistro and bar. Shower water pressure could have been better, sink too low."

Le Meridien Essex Chicago,Looking forward to my next visit! Loved the location and the stylish interiors. The staff was so helpful and friendly. Cafe was lovely. The bathroom layout was cramped and not enough towel racks for two people.
Hotel Lincoln,"Very Good Clean, convenient, quiet. Had to request refills of coffee, creamer, and toilet paper."
Hotel Lincoln,The property is in an area away from the touristy downtown. There are good choices to eat within walking distance. It was near the event we were attending. We had some issues with the shower which were resolved.
Hotel Lincoln,"All is well that ends well. We have been staying at The Hotel Lincoln for our Chicago visits since my bachelor party in June 1990 (likely 40 - 60 nights or so)! While the hotel itself could use some upgrading, the location, location, location is exceptional for our needs. We booked a Suite Room with a Lake View via Booking.com. We called the hotel the morning of check in from San Francisco Airport to confirm that we would be checking in around 9:30 pm and the hotel confirmed our Lake View room. Upon arrival the front desk indicated they did not have a Lake View Suite available. Really???? WTF!!! To make matters worse the clerk tried to blame Booking.com. Well, like any good hotel they did the right thing by offering to try to get the room we booked for the next two nights and gave us a $40 for credit. The next day we moved into the room we had booked and all was good. We know it’s petty to worry hotel room views … but we did pay a premium for that room. Bottom line is we will return to the Hotel Lincoln."
Hotel Lincoln,A wonderful stay without a doubt! The vibe The elevator
Hotel Lincoln,Very nice Convince to Lakeshore Drive and the beach along with resturants Slow elavators
Hotel Lincoln,Would go again Breakfast was fine Nothing
Hotel Lincoln,Very Good Great location. Had hot water coming out of both sink faucets at night. Difficult to brush teeth. Seemed to resolve itself by morning.
Hotel Lincoln,Dated hotel/ fair price/ excellent location Location great. Safe. Near restaurants bars in old town behind hotel Ice machines broken except on 1 floor
Hotel Lincoln,"Perfect place to stay while hanging out in Chicago, especially Lincoln Park. Eclectic vibe. Great location. Bed was a bit small."
Hotel Lincoln,"I would definitely stay there again because of the location. Great location, comfortable beds. The heating/cooling mechanicals were so noisy, sleep was impossible without ear plugs, even with them the motor was a dull roar."
Chinatown Hotel Chicago,"Good Easy to book, check in, location. Eh the stairs but no biggie"
Chinatown Hotel Chicago,"Close to metro and bakeries. No elevator. The hotel is just behind the gate of Chinatown. There is a big advantage, there are windows you can open, The street is quiet, so it is good to sleep there. You can find some bakeries and chinese restaurants in close neighborhood. Hot water goes almost immediately in the shower. There is a common fridge, microvawe and hot and cold water distributor. Red line metro station Cermak Rd. is very near. There is no lift although there are four floors. It would be nice to wash the carpets."
Chinatown Hotel Chicago,"For the price and location to McCormick Place it was worth it for a budget traveller It was close to the Red line No hangars in the closet
Sink was damaged"
Chinatown Hotel Chicago,Will come back for Chinatown Location Some smell
Chinatown Hotel Chicago,cheap sleep If your looking for a bang for your buck this is it!🤣 The rooms are simple and to the point. All the amenities of a larger room just kid size. So if your looking for an inexpensive stay in Chicago this is it. They have street parking but do not park on the street I repeat so not park on the street 😭 They charge $40-50 for parking trust me do it. Parked on the street and came out and somebody had stole my Cadillac converter it was literally parked right across from the hotel. So instead of being out $50 I'm out $450 😭🤦
Chinatown Hotel Chicago,Fair Good N/A
Chinatown Hotel Chicago,"Good Staff were nice, very cool location, good ac"
Chinatown Hotel Chicago,"Bare Bones Minimum here, but that is what we wanted. Staff was super friendly. Answered any questions I had. Had water, snack, etc. Available for $1.50 at the front. NO BUGS in the room. Shower head's internals were gone, so it shot out water like it was on jet mode. Rooms were ugly as hell"
Chinatown Hotel Chicago,"Good Cheap, and clean. Location Bare bones"
Chinatown Hotel Chicago,well we almost had our car tow because of the Chinese year they didn’t tell us but don’t come down here on Chinese New Y it was cheap and close to Chinatown parking
L7 Chicago by LOTTE,Rooms are amazing and staff are just as amazing Center of all what is happpening
L7 Chicago by LOTTE,Loved it Exceeded my expectations .
L7 Chicago by LOTTE,"I would return and highly recommend Amazing Location, large clean rooms very good value for money. Compliementary coffee was also great Everything was v good but if nitpicking a bigger gym and maybe more refined concierge service - Staff were very helpful added knowledge wasnt anything above & beyond what I would find online - ie more local expertise would hav ebeen a nice added bonus"
L7 Chicago by LOTTE,"Exceptional Amazing rooms, great service No complaints"
L7 Chicago by LOTTE,"Wonderful Clean, comfortable and quiet hotel in a great location. Loved the gym and coffee in the lobby. I was given a cupcake for my birthday which was a nice touch too. Nothing - everything was fab."
L7 Chicago by LOTTE,"First time visiting the city for a short stay Centrally located right next to the river, spacious room and lots of amenities"
L7 Chicago by LOTTE,"Really good hotel but needs some refining on service Great rooms
Comfortable
Good location
Clean Gym equipment limited
Housekeeping often came at 4pm/5pm which is not ideal on a city break
Reception were inconsistent. Saw numerous people given hot towels and information on check in but we were not given any of that
River view room was a stretch"
L7 Chicago by LOTTE,"Great location and comfort, a genuinely enjoyable stay. The location was perfect, and I loved the window seat looking out over the river — such a nice feature for a city hotel. The bed was super comfortable, and the room was refreshed with fresh towels every day. The door staff and reception were so good, the bellman guy was in a great mood everytime which just perks you up when you arrive back ! The cleaning staff were really lovely and even made small towel designs, which was a nice touch. The room we got wasn’t exactly what I paid for — it was very similar, just a bit smaller. The shower pressure also wasn’t the best, but it wasn’t a deal-breaker, and the bathroom itself was lovely. The TV was pretty old for such a modern hotel, which was a bit annoying, but we were able to use Google Chromecast from our phone/iPad so it still worked out fine."
L7 Chicago by LOTTE,"Excellent option for downtown stays. Work booked me into a hotel called Club Quarters around the corner from L7 and it was terrible. So I checked myself out and booked here instead. It’s lovely at almost the same price point as the terrible hotel. Will definitely stay again next time I come to Chicago for work. The staff was lovely, the room was spacious, stylish and clean. And best of all it was quiet. I couldn’t perceive any street noise or hallway noise, nor could I hear neighbors. This is not the hotel’s fault but as soon as you walk out the door you are hit over the head with the giant sign from the Trump International, and I don’t like that. Also the downtown location, while convenient for my work, leaves a lot to be desired in terms of nearby nightlife. But again that’s just downtown Chicago."
L7 Chicago by LOTTE,"Amazing stay The Suite we stayed in was beautiful! Amazing views, very very clean, wish we could have stayed longer! The Staff were absolutely amazing....very helpful, absolutely loved them. And the Valet Parking was wonderful! During our stay, I knew my car was safe, we traveled to Chicago to go to a show at the Theater, only a couple of blocks away, and the Hotel was within walking distance to everything we could possibly need. I would definitely tell people to stay there, and when we come back, I would definitely make this Hotel our Hotel to stay in at all times."
The Wade,"Unforgettable Easy check in, wonderful room, great view I loved how close it was to things"

The Wade,Very Good Very convenient location to Navy Pier and city center. Rooms were very clean and well maintained. The lake view is well worth the extra Price was expensive but for central Chicago acceptable.
The Wade,"It was amazing The view is absolutely amazing on either side. The city view or lakeview is beautiful. The location was close to everything, you can either walk or ride share depending on you. We liked everything"

Arlo Chicago,"Great stay excellent location wonderful and friendly staff. Will return Great location, friendly and professional staff, rooms were wonderful.

Arlo Chicago,"Very Good Friendly staff
Convenient location Traffic noise at times"
Arlo Chicago,Wonderful Staff
Arlo Chicago,Great place in the city The location was great for seeing the city. The lobby restaurant was excellent at breakfast. Easy luggage service helped a lot on check out so we could still explore before leaving town. I thought the box of stuff available in the room to purchase was stocked with stuff that was a little pervy.
Arlo Chicago,Great stay in a great city. Great location. Walkable area and across from a bus stop for further travel. The restaurant downstairs had amazing food and drinks. N/a
Arlo Chicago,Wonderful Welcoming and responsive staff. Good location. Comfortable. The price was a little high.

"Radisson Blu Aqua Hotel, Chicago","Great stay in the Windy City over Thanksgiving break. Rooms and bathrooms were very clean. Hotel was in walking distance Close to the RiverWalk, Michigan Ave, Millenium Park, Theater district.
Double queen room is a nice size for three-four people"
"Radisson Blu Aqua Hotel, Chicago","Good position in Chicago Well placed in Chicago downtown , staff good with the smile . That is a good point
Very clean room and common lobby No breakfast , only on the restaurant nearby , but expensive (100 for 4)
Mattress of the room need to be changed absolutely"

"Radisson Blu Aqua Hotel, Chicago","Wonderful Love the location. Love the updated rooms. What matters most is that it was clean, and we had a fantastic view. A few things need to be addressed, trash can in the bathroom. The shower door has a poor design and leaks quite a bit of water. There was an issue with the parquet, should be fixed."
"Radisson Blu Aqua Hotel, Chicago","Blu Aqua was decent Nice pools, great location. Room, especially bathroom could have been cleaner. Baseboards and walls around toilet was dusty and obviously had not been wiped in some time."
"Radisson Blu Aqua Hotel, Chicago",My son and I loved it! Location and amenities The elevator doors close WAY to Quick after you get in or exit. Someone would have to hold the door every time for the people behind you (if there was any). Thats all
"Radisson Blu Aqua Hotel, Chicago","Great location although the fire station next door will stop you from getting any sleep Friendly staff
Clean
Great location - can walk to Navy Pier and the loop easily Average facilities. The one bar is rather dingy although staff were nice. Our room wasn’t ready at 4.30pm despite check in being from 3. We were sent for a comp drink and food there although we weren’t really hungry!
The main problem is that the hotel is next to a Fire Station. The double glazing does nothing to keep out the sound of the siren at all hours. Don’t expect to sleep."
The Royal Sonesta Chicago River North,I love them and definitely will be back💕 I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PROPERTY The pool we wished is was open after hours for 24+ adults to have peace time in the pool
The Royal Sonesta Chicago River North,Wonderful!! We stayed on the top floor that was recently remodeled. It was absolutely beautiful. The beds were comfortable. The view was amazing.

The views are breathtaking, from any angle and the location couldn’t be anymore convenient to everything!! We would have liked more options for a quick breakfast. The breakfast we did have from Terrace 16 was just average at best, and was expensive. We did do dinner there too it was very good and of course views of the gorgeous night skyline were a bonus!!!"
Trump International Hotel & Tower Chicago,A really enjoyable stay and enjoyed watching the English premiership on telly. Iconic hotel in a great location. Lobby was extremely small for size of hotel
Aloft Chicago Mag Mile,"Great hotel in a great location. Comp tea/coffee is a nice touch Location, facilities and staff Nothing"
Aloft Chicago Mag Mile,"It was ok beside being misled by advertising The hotel had a very nice lobby I paid for a city view, the pictures didn’t match the way the room was showed on the website. I was looking at a building that was blocking the view, I spoke with the manager and he stated that was the best room because it was on the 18h floor. I felt misled with the advertisement and wasn’t pleased at all."
Aloft Chicago Mag Mile,The hotel was clean and quiet. It was conveniently locatedas well The property was in a prime location. Close to everything we wanted to do downtown. The only issue was the parking. The hotel has no parking. You have to park at one of the garages in the area and it’s quite expensive.
Aloft Chicago Mag Mile,"Wonderful Great location, cool vibe, parking structure close."
Aloft Chicago Mag Mile,Chicago mag mile The reception and bar area was a very sociable space. The gym was well equipped.

Hyatt House Chicago West Loop-Fulton Market,Well located and large room Huge room. Liked the division between the beds - made it a bit more private. Breakfast included is a plus. Location is ideal for West Loop and walking to close restaurants and bars. Good service There was a missing divider between the bathroom and bedroom and I stepped on nails multiple times 😬
Hyatt House Chicago West Loop-Fulton Market,"Comfortable room, great location, nice staff. Location very good!
Bed cozy & comfortable.
Liked size of room & great sitting area & kitchen.
Breakfast mediocre at best. Sausage patties & links dried out, eggs not hot, muffins, breads awful, fruit salad ok. An omelet bar would be good - fresh food. Very disappointing breakfast.
Pancakes, French toast dried up
Cold scrambled eggs, dried hard sausages.
Bacon would have been nice alternating with sausages."
Hyatt House Chicago West Loop-Fulton Market,"An enjoyable visit to explore Chicago and watch the marsthon Well situated hotel close to transport to the loop, quiet at night, with a very comfortable bed and useful kitchenette. The room had a pleasant view. We found several excellent restaurants near by. Inclusive breakfast was a plus but not kept well stocked given the flow of people - ran out of cutlery, coffee , yoghurt at various points. Felt like they needed another person on duty given how many were staying there for marathon weekend"
Hyatt House Chicago West Loop-Fulton Market,"Wonderful Clean, great amenities, lovely staff, baggage holding. Not applicable"
Hyatt House Chicago West Loop-Fulton Market,Very pleasant Nice staff. Good location. Nice room.
Hyatt House Chicago West Loop-Fulton Market,"Amazing location and rooms! Loved everything about our stay!
The room, the kitchenette/lounge suite and bathroom were very spacious! Even loved the mini/partial divider wall between the beds. The food choices at breakfast were really nice, as well. Staff was super friendly! We will DEFINITELY return here!"
Hyatt House Chicago West Loop-Fulton Market,"Loved the hotel. Hated the parking situation. Pontea Lewis, the front desk manager, was very helpful with our issue with parking. All of the staff was very helpful and freindly. The parking situation was really bad. They only have 20 parking spots in the garage for a 200 room hotel. I could not find parking spaces available near the hotel. I ended up feeding a meter outside the hotel until the front desk manager helped us find one in the garage at 10:30 at night."
Hyatt House Chicago West Loop-Fulton Market,Comfortable stay Location Breakfast was limited on Saturday
Hyatt House Chicago West Loop-Fulton Market,"Excellent Stay in the Windy City Staff was friendly and helpful. Location was excellent with lots of resturants and shops around. Plus it was an easy 20 minute walk to the United Center. Not much parking on site(parking garages were close and cheaper though), fridge in the suite was small and not as cold as it could be."
Hyatt House Chicago West Loop-Fulton Market,"Wonderful Good location. Easy to get to and was able to find parking around the hotel. Walking distance to bars and restaurants. Quiet area. Just a little bit pricey.

Check in at 3. Room wasn't ready yet when we arrived at 3. Maybe half an hour extra wait."

We were looking forward to a drink at the bar with our fiends who stayed at the hotel.
NO room for us and super loud."
"THE MIDLAND HOTEL, Chicago, a Tribute Portfolio Hotel","Very Good The rooms were spacious and nice, staff was friendly and helpful. Free coffee in the morning was a nice perk. They left me keep my luggage there before my flight which was nice and everyone there was super friendly Room service fees were expensive, shower water entered bathroom because of design"
"THE MIDLAND HOTEL, Chicago, a Tribute Portfolio Hotel",Very helpful ladies at reception Convenient location. Subway nearby to everything . Walk to everything Rooms are dark and underilluminated.
"THE MIDLAND HOTEL, Chicago, a Tribute Portfolio Hotel","Really lovely stay, in a great location. No tea/coffee in room but kindly provided when requested. They provide this in the morning in the lobby. Beautiful selection of teas. Staff very courteous and helpful. Lovely decor and ambience of hotel. Walking past the massive air con units to our room, a bit chilly. Air con does generally seem to be set to an excessively low temperature in America, so you are boiling outside and freezing inside!"
"THE MIDLAND HOTEL, Chicago, a Tribute Portfolio Hotel","Great hotel in my favorite big city. The staff was excellent—friendly and helpful. The location is ideal, walkable to a lot of great sites in the city. The bar in the lobby is a lot of fun for having a drink or just hanging out. I loved the room. You pay a lot for a hotel this nice, so it's not cheap."
"THE MIDLAND HOTEL, Chicago, a Tribute Portfolio Hotel","Very good Good location, clean and comfortable room Sometimes noisy"
"THE MIDLAND HOTEL, Chicago, a Tribute Portfolio Hotel","Great sleep, with some sticky spots. The bed was perfect! Super soft sheets, non-spring mattress. I slept so well.
The decor and room arrangement was very appealing! The bathroom was HUGE - but empty.. Really could've used a ledge or a small table next to the toilet. (somewhere to put my phone down during toilet-paper time).
The head/shade on the desk lamp was ridiculously sticky for some reason. And the mini-fridge had dried-up spills in it.
Also, took a long time to call an elevator - even with 4 main cars, and a service car running."

Hyatt Regency Chicago,Great location Fantastic location
Hyatt Regency Chicago,It was ideal for my trip Location Breakfast
Hyatt Regency Chicago,Exceptional The hotel accommodated us with our check-in. We arrived at 9:30 am and they let us check into our room no extra charge. The hotel is in an excellent hotel for tourists who don’t want to rent a car or pay for rides because there was so much to do in the area.
Hyatt Regency Chicago,"Exceptional Our view was lovely furniture was nice and clean lots food inside hotel Had to pay extra check in early and had to pay to Valet park price was bit high.

Fairfield Inn and Suites Chicago Downtown-River North,"Excellent staff, location, and accommodations! Breakfast - is ok. Room, service, and the exercise facility were all excellent. Location was excellent. The breakfast staff were 10/10. The standard warm eggs, sausages, etc were a 6/10, no waffle maker or pancake maker - which I really missed and kids enjoy -so that was a loss for me. Fresh fruit was good. Overall acceptable. Maybe A total 7/10 rating. The hotel is no nice and convenient that the breakfast just being ok is still 100% worth it."
Fairfield Inn and Suites Chicago Downtown-River North,"Great location, great value, great attention. Location is perfect, close to the main tourist attractions. Javier and Fannie attention is wonderful, always ready to help. Hotel is located in across the street of the fire department, so may be a little bit noisy, nothing extreme."
Fairfield Inn and Suites Chicago Downtown-River North,Good location. Location. Breakfast.
Fairfield Inn and Suites Chicago Downtown-River North,"Very Good The location is pretty good. Right in front of the fire department, but was still silent. The breakfast could be a little better, but there were fruit options, pastry, dairy…"
Fairfield Inn and Suites Chicago Downtown-River North,"Decent Facility was clean, room was a little cramped for a family of 5 but it all worked out. Wish the walls were more soundproof. The only thing that made my stay bad was the parking situation—when checking in, the front desk staff didn’t properly explain to us about handing in our parking ticket to be validated for unlimited in/out access, so we ended up having to pay ~$100 for a night stay of parking. Very frustrating. The front desk staff on the next shift properly explained to us, she was a Black young lady and she was patient, kind, and gave us some snacks on the house so that made our frustration go down a little."
Fairfield Inn and Suites Chicago Downtown-River North,Wonderful Great customer service. Especiali Javier is a great guy.
Fairfield Inn and Suites Chicago Downtown-River North,"Highly recommend! I hope you get to meet these two from the breakfast staff. Great location! We especially have fond memories of Fanny and Javier—they always entertained us during breakfast! A good location in Downtown comes with the challenge of parking and unloading luggage, especially on Friday and Saturday evenings."
Fairfield Inn and Suites Chicago Downtown-River North,"Good Location Elevators were not working for an extended time, over two days."
Fairfield Inn and Suites Chicago Downtown-River North,Have stayed at same hotel multiple times and it continues to meet our expectations. Great location. Ideal location of hotel. Comfortable bed and room. Convenient breakfast included. All good
Fairfield Inn and Suites Chicago Downtown-River North,Very Good Location. Very helpful and friendly staff. Not sustainable. Everything at breakfast was disposable.
Level Chicago Fulton Market,"Fine corporate apartment type stay Apartment style stay Difficult check in procedure, no live tv"
Level Chicago Fulton Market,Best hotel stay ever. Cleanliness of the hotel. The special accommodations! They also let me stay in the hotel until our flight later that night! Held our bags while we explored the rest of Chicago. This will always be my place of choice. Couldn’t find beverages or vending machine.
Level Chicago Fulton Market,"Great location, clean, safe! Location, safety Studio was a bit tight."
Level Chicago Fulton Market,"More than a hotel. More like a condo (probably long term intent) than a hotel. Kitchenette, roomy (relative to a hotel room). Not best location if doing a lot of walking, but returned from dinner after 9:00 with no issues."
Level Chicago Fulton Market,Wonderful No breakfast 🥹
Level Chicago Fulton Market,Excellent accomadation Excellent amenities Price was a lil high
Level Chicago Fulton Market,Great building with the best amenities Building amenities were fantastic. Reception was very helpful with anything we needed. Parking was absurdly expensive ($68 a day).
Level Chicago Fulton Market,Worth staying again . Clean environment nice staff clean facilities very nice ! No indoor pool but it’s worth the stay still .
Level Chicago Fulton Market,"More Than Expected! The location was phenomenal! In the heart of Fulton Market with easy access to restaurants, grocery stores, coffee shops, etc. The traffic getting there, but that's Chicago."
Level Chicago Fulton Market,Exceptional I loved Level from the moment I got there. Everything was great!! The long background check process had some hiccups.
voco Chicago Downtown - Riverwalk by IHG,We enjoyed our stay. Kevin was great! Colorful and very inviting
voco Chicago Downtown - Riverwalk by IHG,"Ok but we did not get what we booked. Clean rooms Have to take 2 elevators each way because the reception is in the 15th floor. Booked rooms with 2 Queen beds, got rooms with only one King bed and front desk person insisted on gaslighting us saying that we did not book 2 beds even after we showed him the reservation details. He said it was a Booking.com error, avoiding responsibility. He even said that they didn’t have Queen rooms but the following night they did give us one ! Ridiculous attitude."
voco Chicago Downtown - Riverwalk by IHG,Would come back in a hurry Kevin on front desk is amazing The access to the hotel could be easier from reception to the rooms
voco Chicago Downtown - Riverwalk by IHG,Chicago was fun and we will visit again Location and city views Lots of waiting for elevator
voco Chicago Downtown - Riverwalk by IHG,"Next time we’re in Chicago, we’ll be sure to book here again! The property was very easy to get to and navigate! The elevators would be confusing at times."
voco Chicago Downtown - Riverwalk by IHG,"Very Good Nice property. Two elevators to get to rooms, however, it was a very nice hotel. We had a good time."
voco Chicago Downtown - Riverwalk by IHG,"Great accommodations and great location Loved the roomy, lobby and view They can't change this but it was a little inconvenient to go from parking garage to building entrance to elevator to 16th floor where you finally get to the lobby. That said, the hotel was beautiful and a great stay."
voco Chicago Downtown - Riverwalk by IHG,"We had a quick overnight stay that was perfectly acceptable The property was clean and comfortable. The lobby restaurant bar and common areas had no air-conditioning. Very uncomfortable to stand and wait or to enjoy breakfast. The rooms however, had air and we’re just fine."
voco Chicago Downtown - Riverwalk by IHG,"Staff wonderful, view fantastic, location excellent, rooms clean. Location, 24/7 store , amenities, Not enough gym equipment"
voco Chicago Downtown - Riverwalk by IHG,"Good The location, the cleanliness and the view from the room THE STAFF WERE SO RUDE!! The older black lady with glasses was rude in multiple occasions to me and my friends. She was not helpful or happy to be there she didn’t smile and had an attitude. I even complimented her and she ignored me.

We also requested the bellhop thing for our bags as we had excessive luggage. She said we’ll go get it after she said she was send it up.

It’s ok if they couldn’t send it but no need to be rude"
Hyatt Centric The Loop Chicago,"Thanksgiving 2025 was incredible, a large part because of this hotel. First off, the location could not have been better. A quick walk from our parking garage and close to the train stations and walking distance to other locations. Second, the staff were great, easy check in and cleaning staff did a good job at keeping the room clean. Third, the view from our 10th floor room was incredible. It was truly something that added to this great trip. Fourth, I was able to lock in a good price. Fifth, I loved the access to The Corner, a 3rd floor community room offering free snacks and drinks. Sixth, it was only 2 blocks away from the Thanksgiving Parade, so making it the perfect place to stay for our Thanksgiving trip. There wasn't anything about our stay or about the hotel that I did not like. I would have liked to eat at the hotel restaurant located in/near the lobby but due to the price, we were not able to. I realize that the restaurant itself sets its own prices and the Hyatt hotel company have no control over that. So, I do not hold that against them."
Hyatt Centric The Loop Chicago,"Wonderful The hotel was awesome! Great location and the views of downtown was good IF you are on a high floor. I didn't like one of the check-in ladies who was being a smarty about me moving to a higher floor the next day of our trip when I was told that we would be able to move. I wish I had gotten her name! Everyone else besides her, customer service was a 10! We did eventually get moved with another check-in lady!"
Hyatt Centric The Loop Chicago,"Love the location of this hotel & the staff was very helpful & friendly! The location was central to everything Location, location, location! Friendly & helpful staff!! Room was comfortable & clean. N/A"
Hyatt Centric The Loop Chicago,"Great hotel: excellent, comfortable room and super location. Would return and recommend. We were lucky to have a fantastic corner room, it was huge and so comfortable. The staff were lovely and easy going, and having the complimentary tea and coffee on 3rd floor until the evening was a bonus when we fancied an extra cup of tea. We would highly recommend it! Somewhere to fill water would be good, although staff were kind enough to provide some water bottles when asked."
Hyatt Centric The Loop Chicago,Great! And will be back. Great location. Comfy bed. Spacious room. Loved it! The wait for the elevator…and this is me being picky.
Hyatt Centric The Loop Chicago,Wonderful the location the staff & the quick responses & how hot the shower was along with the water pressure the bed and pillows were too soft my back hurts
Hyatt Centric The Loop Chicago,"Would stay here again, safe, clean, friendly staff. Great place! Great location, clean rooms, staff was very friendly and accommodating. Restaurant in hotel was delicious but I had called ahead of time and was told the rooftop would be open and it wasn’t which was the main reason I booked this hotel however it was still a good place to stay and rooftop or not I loved it. Parking is too pricey at hotel but you can park a block or two away for a fraction of the cost so it wasn’t a big deal to me. I had a young child with me and I would say it was very good for him and the staff was always so nice to him. Safe location to be in and I felt very comfortable. Would absolutely stay here again! Cheaper parking for guests
More clarification on rooftop availability"
Hyatt Centric The Loop Chicago,"Wonderful location, bed, very nice modern room please start providing glasses and real coffee cups in rooms. The pandemic is over and this is an amenity that should not be overlooked. Very unpleasant to have a cup of tea or glass of water in a paper/plastic cup."
Hyatt Centric The Loop Chicago,"Overpriced but central location Location Paying over $3,000 for my room and the hotel charging $25 to check in an hour early. Even though the room was ready."

Sofitel Chicago Magnificent Mile,"Generally ok. Location excellent. Modern and clean with generally great staff. It was old and showing its age. In my room the desk chair was broken and had to be replaced, a recessed light fixture was falling out of the ceiling. And the bathroom mirror was cracked"
Sofitel Chicago Magnificent Mile,Why spend twice as much at The Peninsula when you could stay at The Sofitel? This is our go-to hotel in Chicago. We love everything about it. Stayed here maybe 20 times.
Sofitel Chicago Magnificent Mile,"Love the location, always clean with friendly helpful staff Love the location The front desk seemed short staffed at prime check in time"
Sofitel Chicago Magnificent Mile,This is our second time at this hotel and we’d be back again. Everything. The coffee at hotel lobby is thoughtful. Bedding is excellent. I wish they give more water in the room. And there should be an electric kettle.
Sofitel Chicago Magnificent Mile,"Very Good Very comfortable bedrooms, good location! Veery friendly staff! Very small and limited gym for a 5 stars hotel. Breakfast is a la cart and with limited choices."
Sofitel Chicago Magnificent Mile,"Great stay A really nice classic hotel with great rooms and bathrooms. In a superb location, close to everything you need. I would stay here again on future trips. For a 5 star hotel they could have done something for the marathon runners and families, that so many others were doing like transport/breakfast (even if just a bagel)/supporters assistance to name a few. It really could have been just a small touch and it would have gone a long way especially considering that so many of the major hotels do this for the weekend. There are 5 elevators and only 2 work, they could improve that for the guests."
Sofitel Chicago Magnificent Mile,The staff was lovely and wonderful. The location is perfect as you’re steps away from the magnificent mile and a mile from Millennium Park. The rooms are small as you would expect in a big city.
Sofitel Chicago Magnificent Mile,Amazing location Highly recommend and worth every penny! Beautiful hotel in the downtown magnificent mile of Chicago area with wonderful staff !
Sofitel Chicago Magnificent Mile,One night stay in central location. Close to every thing we wanted including a cracking restaurant Comfy room and beds

Courtyard Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,"All in all, a very good stay. Front desk staff was friendly. The room was clean. The location was ideal -- very close to shopping and restaurants. Our view was horrible. I requested a very high floor, which we did not get, and our view was looking directly at the Riu Hotel. I was very disappointed with that."
Courtyard Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,Very Good Location
Courtyard Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile,Wonderful Great area Bed was very uncomfortable and why are there no microwaves in the room for as much as it cost

Hampton Inn Chicago West Loop Fulton Market Area,"Would definitely make this my home hotel when I come to visit my daughter Clean, close to areas I visited ,staff very friendly and a great breakfast I did not dislike anything. It would’ve been nice to have a microwave in the rooms and the cleaning staff on the floors could have been more quiet. They talked very loud early in the morning on the phone or to each other which I find to be disruptive to the guest, not limited to this hotel it seems to be a problem with hotels I stayed at lately, especially if you want to sleep in at least until 9 AM!"
Hampton Inn Chicago West Loop Fulton Market Area,Everything was nice Closer to train station The roof
Hampton Inn Chicago West Loop Fulton Market Area,"Clean facilities and a great location. Great location near excellent restaurants on Randolph. Clean, decent sized room with comfortable bed. Expensive parking, so reserved parking on my own for less from a nearby structure."

Level Chicago - Old Town,"Highly recommended, we will stay there on our next visit! The property is beautiful with many amenities, loved the many activity options within the building! Loved it all"
Level Chicago - Old Town,"Great accommodation - would 100% recommend Loved the location and the facilities. We loved staying here, the pool and basket ball court and the BBQ areas were really great and often totally empty. The staff were really helpful and the apartment was clean comfortable. I would 100% recommend and would return here. Only a few things that could help others staying. The sofa bedding was not available when we arrived even though we had put it on the booking notes and when we asked for it we were provided with 1 pillow but we have 2 kids. We didn’t know whether the room would be cleaned during our stay, we asked for new towels on day 4 and then we got a knock on the door day 6 to ask if we wanted the room cleaning which we did and great to have the bedding changed but had to rush around to go out to the pool. We also had to ask about where to take the bins as they needed to be emptied. Providing info on arrival would have made it more straightforward. The washing machine needs servicing as it left black marks on our clothing."
Level Chicago - Old Town,Fantastic Location and amenities are fantastic for family No parking
Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile,"Good Great location, clean and modern. Toilets sound like jet engines when flushed. You could hear everything through the walls. We even smelled perfume coming into our room from adjoining room. Had to get a box fan just to sleep. Lighting was horrible couldn’t even see to put on makeup. Would not stay here again."
Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile,Probably will not stay again. The location. Pricey for the value. Check-in was delayed until 4 as room was being cleaned. Check in time on website is 3. The address on the website is 633 St Clair but entrance is not on St Clair but 1 block up and around the corner on Huron. Parking is very pricey. We paid $30 less at another parking facility.
Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile,"The stay was nice and comfy, it will be better once the construction is complete Cleanliness Some of the staff weren’t welcoming"
Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile,Good The shower it doesn't have a lot of power
Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile,"Had a good experience overall Great staff, good view Room was stuffy and a/c wouldn’t kick on. Called and see about upgrading and would pay the difference. Was told there was none available to due so"
Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile,"Great Stay!!! Awesome staff! Very friendly and polite! They were also willing to help us with anything we needed. They gave us complimentary waters, a $15 voucher to use at their indoor restaurant, and housekeeping was nice and professional. The room was stunning and very clean. We got one of their newly renovated rooms and it was way better than what we initially expected. The bathroom had a huge mirror with lighting, it was great for getting ready and doing our makeup and hair. The hotel was in a good location, a lot of our activities could be reached just by simply walking. If we were unable to walk to a destination, then we took uber and the prices for the uber were reasonable. Valet and bellhop were also friendly and polite! They did good a job with helping us with our luggage and car. You are able to come and go as many times as you’d like with your car, and there is not an extra fee for leaving and reparking with the valet. The Amenities were great as well. They had a fitness center, pool, and area for laundry. The lobby was nice, aesthetically pleasing and clean. Lastly, it was just an overall great experience! This hotel exceeded my expectations, the pictures on booking.com really do not do this hotel any justice! N/A"
Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile,Wonderful The staff was friendly and helpful. The beds were so comfortable!
Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile,"Beds were the best! Pillows, bedding perfection! Beds and bedding . Clean. Nice staff. Super close to hospital can be plus or minus. Sirens can be heard but through the night it was quiet. Never heard neighboring rooms or hallway noise. Tons of things to walk to. Restaurants, shopping…. I wish shower had removable head / hose."
Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile,We enjoyed it and will be back next year It had a great whirlpool and the workout room open 24/7 very good location to Walk to everything The room service was over priced and the restaurant didn’t have a big selection of food and was overly priced
Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile,The valet parking is too long of a wait Parking
DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago Magnificent Mile,Wonderful Very accessible to the store near by. Nothing
DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago Magnificent Mile,"Enjoyed it Good , staff lovely"
DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago Magnificent Mile,"Nice property. Very well located. Great location, helpful staff. Comfortable room. Very expensive, probably because the city was hosting the Chicago marathon."
DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago Magnificent Mile,"Wonderful Downtown location
The pool
Rich breakfast
Spacious rooms"
DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago Magnificent Mile,"Love the Doubletree I love the location. My family have been staying here for about 20 yrs. Always comfortable. Friendly staff. You have the best cookies around! Whenever I am in downtown, I will stop in and grab a tin of cookies. This is the first time I found the room lacking. The floor lamp base was extremely dusty, and the wall surrounding it. The toilet is too low. It felt like I was falling. I am 55 yrs old and sometimes my balance isn't the best. This low tiolet was not comfortable. Even my niece said it was too low."
DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago Magnificent Mile,"Good location, cleanliness, friendly staff My daughter and I came from Hungary to Chicago for a System of a Down concert.Great location! Close to Michigan Avenue, where many buses go into the city. Close to Lake Michigan, it was a great feeling to run there in the morning!
The room was very clean, the housekeeper came every day, and if they weren't available they came back!
Close to many restaurants, shops! There were no bathrobes in the room, so it was a hassle to go down to the pool. The hotel looks much nicer in the photos, but in real life it was shabby, a disappointment"
DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago Magnificent Mile,"Very enjoyable stay and would return All the staff at the hotel were very helpful and welcoming.
The room was fairly basic but very comfortable and spotless.
Breakfast was amazing. As we chose the breakfast included option when picking rooms, we were given a $33 credit for each person per day, which could be used in the onsite restaurant at any time of the day. You had the option to either use the A La Carte menu, which was very good or the buffet. We also ate twice in the restaurant in the evening and had very good, reasonably priced meals.
The outside space with the pool was lovely to use after a day of sightseeing, although as expected there are certain times of the day when the sun hides behind a neighbouring skyscraper. There is a little pool shop that sells drinks and snacks.
The location is ideal and close to all top attractions. The gym was very poor with very basic equipment. Bit of a disappointment
It would have been nice to have table coverings on the tables for breakfast.
It was a bit of a shame that after having to check out of the room at 11am, we were unable to use the facilities until we left for the airport at 2pm."
DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago Magnificent Mile,Wonderful Many restaurants and things to do nearby.
DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago Magnificent Mile,Wonderful Parking was very expensive!
DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago Magnificent Mile,"Would stay here again Great location,

Sheraton Grand Chicago Riverwalk,"We enjoyed our short stay and would recommend this hotel for its location. This was a perfect location on the river walk. Walkable to the heart of the business district, shopping, parks and restaurants. You can catch a boat tour of the river just a block away as well as a Big Bus city tour if you don’t feel like walking. The staff was very friendly and gave excellent service."
Sheraton Grand Chicago Riverwalk,"Wonderful The breakfast spread was very good and had a lot of choices. The location was very central located, no need for any transportation, and you can walk to most places. The carpets are a bit old. They charged $5 for room service every time we ordered it, which was not what was expected. It should be free; they are already charging so much for the room, and each day they have an extra $30 charge, so why charge to send something to the room? It's not coming from far away."
Sheraton Grand Chicago Riverwalk,Good for business travels. Well located in the heart of Chicago with a nice river and sea view. Nice fitness and indoor pool for sports in-between. Breakfast buffet is only medium class. Not worth it.
Sheraton Grand Chicago Riverwalk,"Wonderful Great view of the river Expensive breakfast, although delicious, and expensive to park"
Sheraton Grand Chicago Riverwalk,"Great room, good size, good location, and great customer service. Customer service, had an issue and they solved it right away. Breakfast restaurant and hotel need to communicate. Booking says free breakfast and hotel confirmed that, the restaurant said it only includes two adults not my small children. I said well my bookings says breakfast included so you might want to go talk to the hotel manager. Restaurant wanted me to talk to management… I ate breakfast with my family for free each day."
Sheraton Grand Chicago Riverwalk,"Had a great stay. remembered all the points of interest and the facilities offered at the Sheraton Breakfast times, accommodating and a wide range of breakfast styles to suit all palates. Room had a great view across to the Ferris wheel and pier and had a grandstand view of the firework display. Location to the riverwalk and the ease to navigate the city from the Sheraton's location. Internet access at times ....had to keep going to reception to get support in keeping this. Staff were very accommodating and helped every time."
Sheraton Grand Chicago Riverwalk,"Great place for families Location and access to shopping and things to do.
Good size pool for families Very large and busy"
Sheraton Grand Chicago Riverwalk,"Ladies get away turned out awesome, just the relaxation we needed! The location was great, right in the middle of just about everything. Nothing"
Sheraton Grand Chicago Riverwalk,"シカゴ観光には最適な宿 Location was very good. It is easy accessible to major tourist attractions including theaters. The view of riverside from the room was also wonderful. It may be due to the day of the week, but the accommodation fee was expensive. The parking fee in the hotel's basement was also expensive, ant the credit card issued in Japan was not able to use at the ticket issuing machine ( I tried multiple cards, but none of them worked)."
Sheraton Grand Chicago Riverwalk,Wonderful The parking
Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown South Loop,Great price for location and view. The view was amazing! Loved the location. Friendly staff! Housekeeping could of did a better job. Not a big deal because we always clean before getting comfortable. Just wish they would have did better that day.

Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown South Loop,Great place to stay! Pool and hot tub were great! View was beautiful. Location was great. Valet was great! Wish the room was set up differently so that the view could be.more enjoyed.
Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown South Loop,"Great potential. Unprofessional staff. Unfortunately one employee ruined the whole experience for me and I will not be r Beautiful View, Clean, Comfortable room. Valet Drove my car very recklessly through the parking garage, wasn’t until the next day when I watched the dashcam footage and realized. To say the least, I was Furious. I Called the hotel, emailed them the video, was told they would report it and get back to me, now a week has gone by and I still haven’t heard anything from them. Very disappointed with the employees of this hotel."
Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown South Loop,"Great hotel, would recommend We had a corner king room, the view was amazing! Only down side is sharing the pool and hot tub with the other hotel, it gets pretty packed."

Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown South Loop,"Good Location and view 1 elevator was not working.
Difficult to find the entry since it was 2 hotels in one."
Moxy Chicago Downtown,"We had a really great time and the hotel was near a lot of good food and things to see. Who is a really cool place to stay. Because the lobby was games and a restaurant and a bar, we hung out there a lot. It was hard to find a place to put our stuff. For two people, we had a lot of stuff and it was hard to find a place to keep everything. There’s not a chest of drawers or a closet or anything. There’s just a suitcase stand."
Moxy Chicago Downtown,Very kind staff with good quality rooms that made for a great stay Lobby was very special Slightly small room but not too bad for value
Moxy Chicago Downtown,Wonderful Clean. Nice bar in lobby with free coffee and water. Taco bar was only average.

Moxy Chicago Downtown,Wonderful The location of the hotel is excellent. You can walk pretty much everywhere. There's really nice restaurants and bars close to it. The room was very comfortable and had everything we needed The shower in the middle of the room was a bit weird
Moxy Chicago Downtown,Exceptional We loved the location and overall the hotel. We will choose next time we travel to Chi for sure
Moxy Chicago Downtown,"Exceptional Very friendly staff and fun environment. Great if traveling with a pet! They give a sign for the door if you’re leaving your pet in there to go out so housekeepers know, which I thought was great."
Moxy Chicago Downtown,GREAT AND FUNKY! The restaurant and staff were awesome! The ambiance was also excellent. I wouldn't change a thing! The Moxy is funky!!!
Moxy Chicago Downtown,"Nice place definitely perfect for the 20's and 30's crowd. Nice, modern, clean. cold floor could be more comfortable warmer. fresh modern updated"
Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown - Magnificent Mile,"Great location and great facilities and view from our room. Location and friendly staff. Lifts very busy, but not huge problem."
Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown - Magnificent Mile,"All good. We’d come here again. All good. Included buffet breakfast was adequate and of decent quality. Nothing fancy but it served the purpose. Nothing, liked everything."
Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown - Magnificent Mile,Love the location We had a great view overlooking the water and great sunrise view The living Room air condition was not strong. Breakfast variety could use an update.
Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown - Magnificent Mile,"Good location needs some upgrades The location of this hotel is central to many of the tourist sights (Navy Pier, parks, etc). It is alos within walking distance of some very good restaurants and shops along thr Magnificent Mile.
The best part of this hotel is the staff, everyone was courteous and helpful no matter what the ask. I witnessed them helping out several guests and they were always courteous and helpful. The downfall to the llocation of this hotel is tha it doesn't have its own parking and the price you have to pay to park in the garage next door is $69.00 per night. We chose to park a few blocks away for half that price. The room was spacious but needs to be upgraded. There was paint peeling from the ceiling, the toilet was cracked inside, the outlet covers were cracked and the tv and remotes are old, The carpet in the elevators also need to be cleaned. The pillows also need to be changed as they were flat and uncomfortable."
Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown - Magnificent Mile,"In a great place to fully take in Chicago and walk everywhere. Location and size of rooms The elevators take a long time to come and are often sent entirely up or down meaning a long wait and full. Breakfast was good food but choice was limited (one bowl of fruit for the session same food choice each day, no variety) and cutlery was plastic with cardboard plates."
Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown - Magnificent Mile,Very close to AG store which was our main stop and Homestead Suites perfectly located. The room was large and comfortable. The staff was very helpful and friendly. My granddaughter was so very disappointed that the pool was not open.
Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown - Magnificent Mile,"Wonderful Everything during the stay was excellent but the internet service. The location, room and view were very good and was a real comfortable. Accessing the Hotel Wi Fi was a major problem but the hotel staff was able to offer a get around by using a Mobile Hot Spot to get an internet connection and the TV not having a channel guide was also a minor issue."
Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown - Magnificent Mile,"Good Breakfast, location, City views Pool renovations, during summer, with no warning"
Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown - Magnificent Mile,"Pool closed for repairs, loud AC, but otherwise good stay. Great area, friendly staff, spacious and comfortable. I chose it partially because of the pool, but the pool was closed due to repairs, which was not related until we arrived.
While the AC worked beautifully- maintained a steady temp- it was very loud. It did help drown out the sirens, but if you don’t like loud white noise, that ro wouldn’t have been for you."
Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown - Magnificent Mile,Wonderful Great location. -
Kinzie Hotel,"Hotel is good, but breakfast is better to go outside. Location was very good Te breakfast was very bad, rspecially serving food on paper table was very pure. I was really disapoited of this"
Kinzie Hotel,"Loved our stay, almost hated to leave when we went to explore the city. Very beautiful and clean! Everything. Beautiful Hotel. The BEST staff! Check in and Check out were a breeze. Very clean room, lobby, reception room, EVERYTHING. Shower was clean and the provided shampoo, conditioner and body soap were great. Location was ideal! They stored our bags for the day after checkout, so we didn't have to lug them around shopping. Highly recommend this hotel. Will stay here again for sure. I liked everything. If I had to pick something, the only recommendation would be, more towels, etc in the rooms. We had 2 queen beds, 4 people and only 3 sets of towels. However, when we called for more, they came up with more RIGHT AWAY!"
Kinzie Hotel,Chicago at its finest. Very courteous and friendly staff. Everything was perfect.
Kinzie Hotel,Great hotel in a fabulous location. Close to everything. Staff lovely. A little variation in the breakfast would be good. And less plastic! .
Kinzie Hotel,"We had a fabulous stay with a Michigan Win over North Western at Wrigley Field. Go blue The free morning breakfast was a nice perk! The location was perfect to get to all areas of Chicago. Close to shopping, sports events and tons of fab restaurants and local transportation. Our room was perfect and felt very roomy compared to most."
Kinzie Hotel,"Pleasant stay, great views, very safe, great location. Very clean, modern looking. We had to go all the way downstairs to get water. Would love it if there was a water dispenser on each floor. Also offer an extra trash bin for recycle."
Kinzie Hotel,Very Good Hospital and room was nice Unnecessary charges
Kinzie Hotel,"Great location & perfect for weekend stay Location was excellent, everything you wanted to get to was 10mins walk away, room was a decent size and we had a nice view of the city. Staff were always so welcoming and helpful every time you passed through reception. On our last morning the toilet flooded over into the bathroom which was a minor inconvenience but as we were checking out shortly after it didn’t really bother us. Breakfast options weren’t great so we ended up eating out each morning"
Kinzie Hotel,Nice hotel! Walking distance to the Chicago Theater. Staff go out of their way to make you feel comfortable!
Kinzie Hotel,"Exceptional Most kind, friendly and helpful staff"
Hyatt House Chicago Medical/University District,Pleasant stay - not much around it but on top of the blue line! The building - exquisite ! The breakfast felt like a canteen - no finesse at all!
Hyatt House Chicago Medical/University District,Awesome building and location. Friendly staff. Perfect location for United Center. The free breakfast was small variety and too many people and no where to sit. Prefer take away items like pastries and fruit. Extra fee for parking.
Hyatt House Chicago Medical/University District,"Wonderful It’s near the venue of the concert we attend to and it’s so convenient to get here, check in and park. The best part is the room we booked was really beautiful and so clean."
Hyatt House Chicago Medical/University District,"Clean, quiet, comfort perfecf for a stay near the United Center Perfect location for walking to the United Center. Clean and quiet. Hotel bar/restaurant was overpriced but I guess that is to be expected."

"LondonHouse Chicago, Curio Collection by Hilton",Excellent time Location and rooftop
"LondonHouse Chicago, Curio Collection by Hilton","Didn't think I would write a review huh? We LOVED the room and the view!!! The view was amazing from each window and the ambiance was great! One of the staff at the desk was EXTREMELY rude! I booked through Booking. com and apparently the reservation didn't go all the way through. Instead of the staff trying to accommodate me, he went on to tell me that their reservation number didn't start with a 5, that it started with a 3. He proceeded to ask if they sent a confirmation to my email and when I began to tell him my email address, he abruptly cut me off stating, ""I don't need your email, I was asking if they sent it to your email ""! His tone was very unpleasant and as nice as the hotel is and for the prices their charging, they shouldn't have staff working there with such horrible ATTITUDES!! My wife left an item in the room and when she called to speak with the Lost and Found Department and housekeeping, she was on hold for almost an hour while being transferred from department to department and she was also given the run around trying to speak w/a supervisor. The staff should be better trained in terms of professionalism!!! This was not a good look for such a prestigious hotel.

Thank you"

Also the elevators are very slow... it takes quite some time"

Holiday Inn Express Chicago - Magnificent Mile by IHG,Good location and nice accommodation. Convenient breakfast hours. Good breakfast selections. Tranquil night. ?
Holiday Inn Express Chicago - Magnificent Mile by IHG,Good The location is very central Breakfast could be improved with other options. You get tired of eating the same thing every day. Not enough space to keep your clothes
Holiday Inn Express Chicago - Magnificent Mile by IHG,Comfortable bed and clean room. The breakfast could have been better. Closer to various tourist spots and great restaurants The room was tiny for over $200 per night. I likened it to a closet.
Holiday Inn Express Chicago - Magnificent Mile by IHG,"It was okay, parking was horrendous and expensive. No refrigerator, very small to navigate around bed bathroom. Positive thing is room was very clean."
Holiday Inn Express Chicago - Magnificent Mile by IHG,"Great experience! The location is awesome, the breakfast was good and everything was very clean. The AC was a little bit too loud though. I sleep with earplugs so it wasn’t a big deal for me. Also the girls from the reception were very nice. I had a problem with the bed of my room and they changed to another room immediately. I was traveling by myself so I appreciated a lot how safe I felt there. 😊"
Holiday Inn Express Chicago - Magnificent Mile by IHG,Nice cost clean good breakfast. No parking made for a headache plan ahead Clean nice neighborhood No parking available
Holiday Inn Express Chicago - Magnificent Mile by IHG,"Pleasantly surprised, thank you Holiday Inn The property was well-maintained, the bed was comfortable. The room was very clean. The room was on the smaller size for sure. I had a queen size bed, and a desk and a small bathroom felt like a college dorm room, but the value is perfect."
Holiday Inn Express Chicago - Magnificent Mile by IHG,"Very Good The shower drain was extremely slow, so when we showered we were standing in water."
Holiday Inn Express Chicago - Magnificent Mile by IHG,"Convenient and clean It was a nice, convenient, well located hotel. Sufficient for my needs, and clean. It was all fine."

SpringHill Suites by Marriott Chicago Chinatown,"It was good Normal breakfast, good location Everything as expected"
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Chicago Chinatown,Exceptional Super clean and comfy!!!Great location !!! Great staff !!
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Chicago Chinatown,The staff was exceptionally friendly and attentive. Very friendly staff Price
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Chicago Chinatown,"Amazing room, friendly staff and good food This was my first time visiting the US for the Chicago Marathon. The hotel’s location is very strategic — it’s close to McCormick Place, where the race pack collection took place, and only about a 15-minute walk from the hotel. I even went there several times for some shopping at the expo. The hotel is also conveniently located near a train station, making it easy to reach various places around the city.

The hotel facilities and services were excellent. The room was very spacious, and it comfortably accommodated three of us thanks to the extra bed under the sofa. Breakfast was satisfying and well-balanced, offering a good selection of protein, fiber, and coffee. The service was great as well — the staff kindly provided additional access for the third guest staying in our room.

Our room faced the back side of the building and while we could hear some train noise at night, it wasn’t too disturbing. The view of city in the morning is quite good. Overall, I was very satisfied with my stay, and if I come back for the Chicago Marathon, I would definitely consider staying here again."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Chicago Chinatown,"Exceptional Great location, really comfortable and clean rooms. Staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast was awesome. I would highly recommend if traveling for work or for fun."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Chicago Chinatown,Exceptional Position is great for McCormick Place. On the red line for downtown. Staff is awesome. Breakfast is ok!
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Chicago Chinatown,In the middle of china town a remarkable Hotel Great location and great clean rooms and the breakfast was great I wish they had some Chinese selection for breakfast In addition to western
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Chicago Chinatown,Amazing A little bland lack of options. But it ok. I enjoyed Nothing. It's was worth the money
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Chicago Chinatown,New and very clean and great location Location and design of the property. Very new and modern. Easy walk to restaurants. Breakfast was good. Hard to park. Crowded street made it difficult to park to check in.
Cambria Hotel Chicago Loop - Theatre District,confortable walking distance to most of the attractions none
Cambria Hotel Chicago Loop - Theatre District,"Very Good The location was great for walking to different sites in downtown Chicago. Because the location is downtown and very close to theaters, it was noisy. The traffic noise was significant in the afternoon. If you are sensitive to noise, it may not be the best location for you. Otherwise, the hotel was clean and comfortable."
Cambria Hotel Chicago Loop - Theatre District,"Would recommend Awesome location , friendly staff , great parking situation , nice room . Overall great experience would recommend! Smart tv access would’ve been helpful , and one light in my room didn’t work but other than that everything was great thank you"
Cambria Hotel Chicago Loop - Theatre District,"Great location, definitely worth it despite my complaints. It was a great location with modern rooms. I was disappointed with the hotel bar. They were out of almost everything. The pillows were also not up to the quality I would expect for the price point. They were worn out and folded in half to appear fluffier."
Cambria Hotel Chicago Loop - Theatre District,"Clean and safe Location was good- lots to do in the area. Felt safe. Room was very clean The shower was super small
I got a rate that included breakfast in the restaurant and they were literally out of most everything on the menu- very disappointing and they didn’t offer to do anything to make things better."
Cambria Hotel Chicago Loop - Theatre District,"Prefect location, affordable price and clean rooms. The hotel property, including the room was clean and up to date. The location is perfect for visiting the sites in downtown Chicago. There is good parking, lots of food choices and activities within walking distance. The rooms are pretty small but that is not important if you don't plan to spend much time in the room."
Cambria Hotel Chicago Loop - Theatre District,It was decent. Location and the cleanliness of the hotel. Thought I would get some kind of birthday courtesy bring it was me and my son’s birthdays. So that was a little disappointing being that I chose to spend the time there.
Cambria Hotel Chicago Loop - Theatre District,"Wonderful The Cambria Hotel was in a very central location, the beds were comfortable and the hotel was clean. The towels were new and clean, too. We stayed with our two children and were able to walk to lots of places. When we arrived at the Cambria Hotel, we were asked to pay a deposit on top of the cost of our stay. This had not been the case with any of our previous bookings. The deposit was refunded after our stay."
Cambria Hotel Chicago Loop - Theatre District,"Wonderful Center of downtown area, near many transportation options, across the street from what I call a mini mall Breakfast, not too many options"
Cambria Hotel Chicago Loop - Theatre District,"Pleasant staff and stay! Spacious, modern room - good value for the price. Parking option close by to the property. Unable to leave bathroom light on at night, due to noise level of the venting fan, as a guide for nighttime bathroom needs."
Eurostars Magnificent Mile,"GREAT STAY!! The location was absolutely amazing!! Close to everything, walking distance!! The property was great."
Eurostars Magnificent Mile,"Excellent choice Location is very good, staff is beyond friendly, rooms very clean and comfortable. No complaints at all."
Eurostars Magnificent Mile,"Our stay was fantastic. We thoroughly enjoyed the property and will definitely stay there again. Next time we are in Chi The hotel itself was beautiful, and the location was very convenient to many attractions. The property was very secure in that there was always someone at the front desk and the elevators required a room key for access. The room itself was amazing! We had a panoramic room on the 24th floor and the view was fantastic! Housekeeping did an excellent job. The front desk staff couldn’t have been any friendlier or more helpful. We had a problem with the in room safe and called the front desk and someone was at the door within two minutes to help us. The only negative thing I can say is that our room had a funny, musty smell as soon as you entered. I’m thinking it was from the humidity from the bathroom. Once you were in the room for a while, you didn’t notice it. But it hit you in the face when you first opened the door to enter the room."
Eurostars Magnificent Mile,"Exceptional Great location; spectacular view! No real cream for coffee. (coffee mate is not cream…)

Bathroom door needs a way to stay open or closed better."
Eurostars Magnificent Mile,I have stayed here twice already and have loved it both times Love the room and view There was nothing to like.
Eurostars Magnificent Mile,I’ll be back Great Nothing
Eurostars Magnificent Mile,Out stay was magical my husband brought me here for my 44th Birthday 🎂 We really loved this place and will forever be back. Everything was Amazing and well worth it. The breakfast in bed was so Amazing and super delicious. We loved Everything 😍

The Whitehall Hotel - BW Premier Collection,Very Good Rooms and beds Nothing

The Whitehall Hotel - BW Premier Collection,"Good The bed and bedding were super comfortable.
The staff was very friendly and welcoming. The breakfast was not good. More variety and fresh cut fruit would have been nice.
The in room coffee was also not good. The steeper system with coffee in a teabag does not make a decent cup of coffee."
The Whitehall Hotel - BW Premier Collection,"The stay was really nice. The bed was one of the most comfortable sleeps I have had in a long time. Loved the entire sta I love the vintage feel of the property and the cleanliness of the entire building was superb, especially considering the history of the building. The television was dated and the remote did not work efficiently, at all. The breakfast was very subpar to me as well."
The Whitehall Hotel - BW Premier Collection,Very Good Location and the Staff!!
The Whitehall Hotel - BW Premier Collection,Good location and friendly helpful staff Good location for us Some of the wallpaper was peeling. Breakfast was a little disappointing.
Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago West Loop Fulton Mkt Area,"A Great Stay Spacious suite, with a kitchen. Very clean and modern. Quiet, lovely city view. The bed was super comfortable and clean. Large, clean bathroom and modern shower. Breakfast was hot. Waffles, eggs, sausage, oatmeal, muffins, etc. Delicious coffee, too. I highly recommend. Our room key didn't get us out of the parking garage as it was supposed to. We had to call the front desk for help twice."

Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago West Loop Fulton Mkt Area,"Very Good We came back to our room one evening to find that no housekeeping had been done. When we enquired we were told that housekeeping is not done everyday, contrary to what is stated in their room info ""for your comfort, housekeeping services are provided daily"""
Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago West Loop Fulton Mkt Area,"Great!! We actually stayed 5-7 ! It was clean and comfortable! Just parking, it was a bit pricey."

Home2 Suites By Hilton Chicago River North,"It was amazing they respected the do not disturb. Never heard any noise, the bed was super comfortable. Most things are Love the location really near everything The gym can have a little more of equipment"
Home2 Suites By Hilton Chicago River North,"Wonderful Very nice hotel, great location"
Home2 Suites By Hilton Chicago River North,This location and facility was much needed for the purpose of my stay. My room was really great and so was the 24 hour coffee in the lobby. My keys kept demagnetizing no matter what I did making it harder to get back into the building and my room.
Home2 Suites By Hilton Chicago River North,"Very Good Loved the location and staff, everyone was friendly and helpful, also the fire place out on the lobby floor was very cozy Felt like breakfast could be better"
Home2 Suites By Hilton Chicago River North,"Good Location and the cleanliness THE BREAKFAST, it is not good and almost all the days is the same

I did not take my breakfast the last two days, I was tired of the same flavor and food"
Home2 Suites By Hilton Chicago River North,Very Good Localization Breakfast
Home2 Suites By Hilton Chicago River North,"Superb location and facilities Amazing stay at Home2 Suites, room very spacious and clean. Staff was always helpful and friendly Very small thing but missed having shower gel instead of only bar soap"
Home2 Suites By Hilton Chicago River North,"Clean, comfortable room with way too much noise Room was initially clean and comfortable. Walking distance to many good bars, restaurants, and attractions. Easy to Uber to the rest. Front desk staff were fun and friendly. Noise, noise, and more noise. I could stand in my bathroom and hear the person in the next room pee. That’s absurd. Thumps music from nearby club even though I was 7;floors up. Asked for attention to my bathroom after 2 days but no one ever showed up. Men will not appreciate the toilet design."
Home2 Suites By Hilton Chicago River North,"My over all stay was ok! I had to take a warm shower, my room never got clean the entire 4 night stay, I had to ask for The property was in a good walking location. Neat clean, The water would only get warm, the breakfast was cold and mediocre"
Level Chicago - River North,Wonderful Full kitchen with appliances to cook. Enclosed parking especially during the snow. Clean and convenient Very small 2nd bedroom with exaggerated main suite. A little frustrating to call each time to open the parking garage door.
Level Chicago - River North,Very Good The parking is paying everthing else so beautiful
Level Chicago - River North,"Best value in Chicago! Great value with pool, hot tub and arcade for the kids to enjoy. I wish there were food options nearby, but that wasn’t an issue."
Level Chicago - River North,"Beautiful pool, great location for easy access to the city centre Great pool, sauna and steam room and huge gym Sofa bed was not made up on arrival despite having requested a sofa bed. Room
Supposed to accommodate 6 but that would mean 3 people per bed so not really realistic unless you have small children"
Level Chicago - River North,"Worth the Stay Perfect location, garage was greatly needed and would book again"
Level Chicago - River North,"Very Good The sofa bed was very uncomfortable. Also, not having shades in the living room made sleeping there past 4:30am quite challenging."
Level Chicago - River North,"Excellent location, relaxing accomodation, Terrible service communicating & returning ones dep $200 Options to get extra bits if needed; the entry in the lobby is very chic and welcoming. The Elevator was executive style, rooms had nice views and all amenities one needs to relax and enjoy the view. The time it has taken to return my deposit, anything longer than 24 hours, 14 days later, the deposit has still not been returned. It took 5 seconds to give it to them, and 2 weeks with still no return is unacceptable today. I have been using Booking.com since they opened in the late 90s, and well over 500 hotels have been stayed in.

I have never experienced this disrespect around returning one's safety deposit for the room, which had no issues upon checking out! Not replying to myself or Booking.com is not acceptable, either.

Having to follow up on it is also not professional or respectful. No hotel would expect a customer to stay and then two weeks later receive the money, so why should a customer?

It could have more sports channels and plants throughout the facility."
Level Chicago - River North,"Great experience We had an amazing experience from the very first contact with the staff. We had requested a high floor, and they were incredibly friendly and went above and beyond to accommodate us in a stunning suite with breathtaking views. My room was not completely clean"
Level Chicago - River North,"In the heart of Chicago Location, vista, spazi interni e servizi dell’immobile Niente"
Level Chicago - River North,Excellent work stay to givea decent walk anywhere The size and comfortof the apartment for workand someleisure was more than adequate. We used the business centre on the last day and that was excellent! Had no real issues to report.

Hyatt Place Chicago Wicker Park,"Exceptional Good Value for the location and accessibility of everything, and fairly priced, but still pricey when you are coming from out of area. Also, really enjoyed having the valet parking, adds quite a bit to the bill but again, I expect this when coming to Chicago. Can't think of anything."
Hyatt Place Chicago Wicker Park,"Good hotel, would recommend. Good large room, comfy bed, Good bathroom. Everything was adequate. The lobby was on the highest floor of the hotel. So if you go downstairs to the street level to book an u er, then there is no place for you to wait. Not a single chair, etc. I found that very odd.
Also, Sketchy neighbourhood"
Hyatt Place Chicago Wicker Park,Great staff! Location to concert venue
Hyatt Place Chicago Wicker Park,"Exceptional!! My sister and I stayed overnight here while in town and were very pleased! The suite was very clean and comfortable, the staff were helpful and kind, and the breakfast was delicious! If we are ever in town again, we will definitely return!

Acme Hotel Company Chicago,"A great hotel for a tourist in Chicago The hotel was in the perfect location for exploring the city, close to the train and walking distance from lots of tourist sites.
The staff were helpful and friendly. The hotel was clean, tidy and felt modern. The room and bathroom were a suitable size for a couple staying for a week. Having a bar and bakery on site was very useful. The one minor thing was the windows weren't noise proof so I could hear all the outdoor sounds at night even though our room was not facing the street."
Acme Hotel Company Chicago,"Decent value, great location Great location. Clean facilities. Friendly and helpful staff Bed was uncomfortable"
Acme Hotel Company Chicago,"Fabulous. Will definitely come back- the negative points wouldn’t put me off Amazing location and very quirky hotel with lovely bar.
